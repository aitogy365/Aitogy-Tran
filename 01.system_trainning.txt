Surveying may be defined as the art of making measurement of the relative positions of natural and manmade features on the Earth’s surface, and the presentation of this information either graphically or numerically.
Distances, angles, directions, locations, elevations, areas and volumes are thus determined from data of the survey. Also, much of the information of the survey is portrayed graphically or numerically by the construction of maps, profiles, cross-sections and diagrams.
Thus, the process of surveying may be divided info the field-work of talking measurements and the office-work of computing and drawing necessary to the purpose of the survey.

The earliest surveys known were for the purpose of establishing the boundaries of land, and such surveys are still the important work of many surveyors.
Every construction project of any magnitude is based to a greater of lesser degree upon measurements taken during the process of a survey and is constructed about lines and points established by the surveyor. Aside from land surveys, surveys are of assistance in the conception, design, and execution of engineering works.
Surveys are conducted for a variety of purposes, such as the fixing of national and state boundaries, the charting of coast lines, and navigable streams and lakes, the precise location of definite reference points throughout the country, the collection of valuable facts concerning the Earth's magnetism at widely scattered stations, the mapping of certain
 
portions of the country, particularly in the location of valuable mineral deposits, est.
Summing up, surveys are divided into three classes:
-	Those for the primary purpose of establishing the boundaries of landed properties,
-	Those forming the basic of a study for or necessary to the construction of public and private works and
-	Those of large extent and high precision conducted by the government. There is no hard and fast line of determination between surveys of one class and those of another, as regards of methods, employed, results obtained, or use of the data of the survey.

Việc đo đạc sớm nhất được biết đến là nhằm phục vụ cho mục đích thiết lập ranh giới đất đai, và những công tác ấy vẫn là công việc quan trọng của những người trắc địa.
Các dự án xây dựng ở bất kỳ mức độ nào, dù ít hay nhiều đều dựa trên việc tạo ra trị đo trong quá trình đo đạc và được xây dựng theo các đường hoặc điểm được lập bởi những người đo đạc. Ngoài đo đạc đất đai, trắc địa còn giúp lập các ý tưởng, thiết kế, và thực hiện các công trình xây dựng.
Việc đo đạc được tiến hành cho nhiều mục đích, như việc xác định ranh giới quốc gia và khu vực, lập bản đồ đường bờ biển và những dòng suối và hồ nước có thể đi lại được, vị trí chính xác các điểm trải dài trên khắp cả nước, việc thu thập các dữ kiện có giá trị liên quan tới trường trọng lực của Trái đất tại các trạm phân bố rộng khắp, thành lập bản đồ từng khu vực của đất nước, đặc biệt ở vị trí các mỏ khoáng sản có giá trị, v.v
Tóm lại, công tác đo đạc được chia thành ba phần chính:
-	phục vụ mục đích chính là phân biệt ranh giới, đặc tính của các thửa
đất.
-	Tạo ra các nền tảng cho việc nghiên cứu hoặc sự cần thiết cho xây
dựng các công trình công cộng và cá nhân

Geodetic surveying is actually branch of surveying distinguished both by use and technique. In geodetic surveying large areas of the Earth’s surface are involved and the curvature of the Earth must be taken into
 
account. As will be explained shortly, framework of angular and distance measurements between points are necessary to control all surveys and when surveying large areas, such as a whole country, the measurements must be taken to the highest possible standard. Modern methods for this task include global positioning system which use transmissions from satellites to obtain the three dimensional co-ordinates of any point on the Earth’s surface to a high degree of accuracy. The study of the size and shape of the Earth and its gravity field is known as geodesy, hence the name of this type of surveying.

Triangulation is employed extensively as a means of control for topographic and similar surveys. A triangulation system consists of a series of triangles in which one or more sides of each triangle are also sides of adjacent triangles. The lines of a triangulation system form a network tying together the points or stations at which the angles are measured. The vertices of the triangles are the triangulation stations.
By the use of the triangulation method, the necessity of measuring the length of every line is avoided. If it was possible to measure one side and all the angles in a triangulation system with absolute precision, no further linear measurements would be necessary. Unavoidable errors in the field measurements, however, make it desirable the lengths of two or more lines in each system be measured as a means of checking the computed distances. The lines whose lengths are measured are called based lines.
The arrangement of the triangles in most system affords many different geometrical figures for each of which the theoretical value of the sum of the included angles is known. Also, the sum of the angles about any station should equal 3600, and in any triangle the lengths of the sides should be proportional to the sines of the angles opposite. There known
 
conditions serve as a measure of the precision of the angle measurements and as a means of adjusting the errors so as to secure the most probable values of the measured quantities.
It is not necessary that every angle in a triangulation system be measured; the third can be readily computed. This procedure, however, does not permit the application of the known conditions as a measure of the precision of the measurements, or as a means of adjusting the errors. Therefore, it is customary to measure all angles. If all angles were measured, rather more information would be available than required, but it is characteristic of these surveys that additional (or redundant) measurements are taken both to check the data and by adjustments to improve the precision of the final results.

Lưới tam giác được thực hiện rộng rãi như một phương tiện để khống chế địa hình và công tác đo đạc tương tự. Một mạng lưới tam giác gồm có 1 chuỗi tam giác thì ở đó, một hay nhiều cạnh của tam giác cũng là cạnh của các tam giác liền kề. Các cạnh của một hệ thống lưới tam giác tạo thành một mạng lưới liên kết với nhau ở các điểm và trạm máy, mà ở đó các góc đều được đo. Các đỉnh của hình tam giác là các trạm máy của lưới tam giác.
Bằng việc sử dụng phương pháp lưới tam giác, không cần thiết phải đo chiều dài của tất cả các cạnh. Nếu có thể đo 1 cạnh và tất cả các góc trong lưới tam giác với độ chính xác tuyệt đối, thì việc đo thêm chiều dài các cạnh là không cần thiết. Việc đo đạc ngoài thực địa không thể tránh khỏi sai số, tuy nhiên, làm cho nó thỏa mãn chiều dài của 2 hay nhiều cạnh hơn trong mỗi hệ thống được đo đạc là phương pháp để kiểm tra độ dài tính toán. Những cạnh có chiều dài được đo thì được gọi là cạnh đáy.
Sự sắp xếp của các tam giác trong hầu hết các mạng lưới có thể tạo ra sự khác nhau rất nhiều về đồ hình, với mỗi tam giác trong đồ hình thì tổng lý thuyết của tất cả các góc bên trong là cố định. Cũng như vậy, tổng các góc xung quanh bất kì trạm nào phải bằng 360 độ, và trong mỗi tam giác, chiều dài các cạnh phải tỉ lệ thuận với sin của góc đối diện. Việc thỏa mãn các điều kiện đã biết đó phục vụ đánh giá độ chính xác đo góc và như là 1 phương pháp bình sai các sai số để cho đạt được kết quả xác suất của nhiều trị đo.
 
Không cần thiết phải đo tất cả các góc trong mạng lưới tam giác, góc thứ 3 có thể được tính toán ra một cách dễ dàng. Thủ tục trên, tuy nhiên, không thể cho phép áp dụng các điều kiện đã biết trong việc tính toán độ chính xác của các trị đo, hoặc như một phương pháp để bình sai các sai số. Vì thế, người ta thường đo tất cả các góc. Nếu tất cả các góc đều được đo, ta sẽ biết nhiều thông tin hơn yêu cầu, nhưng nó là đặc trưng cho trắc địa, cái mà các trị đo thừa đều được thực hiện để kiểm tra các trị đo và bình sai để tăng độ chính xác của kết quả cuối cùng.

2.	Bài đọc:
In a system of triangulation, long sides (within proper limits) are obviously more economical than short ones. It is difficult and expensive to measure long base lines; hence, in practice, the base lines are usually much shorter than the average length of the triangle sides. This condition necessitates the most careful attentions to the location of the base lines and the immediately adjacent stations. The figure formed by this group of stations is called the base net and is formed so as to permit economical lengths of triangles sides to be used with a minimum less in the precision of the measured base line.
The figure 2.1.a is an example of an excellent base net affording quick and accurate expansion of the base line to the longer sides of the system. The form of base net show in the figure 2.1.b is satisfactory if it can be so laid out as to avoid the small angular.

Figure 2.1: Base Nets
Scheme of the simple design discussed so far are extremely useful when EDM instruments and calculating aids are not available because distance measurement and calculation can be kept to a minimum. However, when EDM equipment is available then more than one distance would be measured and the layout of the control scheme would not be restricted to braced quadrilaterals and centre-point polygons. In fact, we could measure lengths only, thereby producing a trilateration framework.
Most modern control scheme involved both angular measurement and the measurement of selected, or all, sides and so should no be called simply triangulation or trilateration surveys, by convention, the name triangulation generally applies.

Trong một mạng lưới tam giác, các cạnh dài (trong giới hạn cụ thể) rõ ràng là kinh tế hơn so với cạnh ngắn. Đo cạnh đáy dài thì khó và đắt tiền, do đó, trong thực tiễn, cạnh đáy thường ngắn hơn nhiều so với độ dài trung bình của cạnh tam giác. Điều kiện này đòi hỏi phải chú ý tới vị trí của cạnh đáy và các trạm liền kề một cách cẩn thận nhất. Đồ hình được thành lập bởi tập hợp các trạm thì được gọi là mạng lưới cơ sở, và nó được thành lập để đạt được độ dài cạnh được sử dụng hợp lí về kinh tế với độ chính xác thấp nhất của các cạnh đáy được đo.
Hình 2.1.a là một ví dụ về một mạng lưới điển hình cho phép mở rộng một cách nhanh chóng và chính xác của cạnh đáy từ những cạnh dài hơn của mạng lưới. Sự Hình dạng mạng lưới cơ sở biểu diễn ở hình 2.1.b là thỏa mãn nếu nó có thể được sắp đặt để tránh được các góc nhỏ.

Hình 2.1. Mạng lưới gốc.
Đồ hình thiết kế đơn giản được thảo luận ở trên là vô cùng hữu ích khi mà không có các thiết bị đo chiều dài điện tử và sự giúp đỡ của máy tính, bởi trị đo chiều dài và tính toán có thể được hạn chế ở mứ thấp nhất. Tuy nhiên, khi thiết bị đo chiều dài điện tử được sử dụng thì nhiều khoảng cách có thể được đo và việc bố trí đồ hình khống chế sẽ không bị hạn chế ở dạng tứ giác trắc địa và đa giác trung tâm. Trên thực tế, ta có thể chỉ đo chiều dài, bằng cách ấy, tạo ra một lưới tam giác đo cạnh.
Phần lớn sơ đồ khống chế hiện đại bao gồm cả đo góc và đo có chọn lọc, hay tất cả, các cạnh và như vậy không nên gọi một cách đơn giản là lưới tam giác đo cạnh, nhưng theo quy ước, tên lưới tam giác nhìn chung vẫn được chấp nhận.

2.	Bài đọc:
The area to be covered by a triangulation scheme must be carefully reconnoitred to select the most suitable positions for the control stations. Existing maps, especially if contoured, can be of great value since the size and shape of the triangles formed by the stations can be difficult to visualize in the field.
When planning the scheme, certain considerations should be kept in mind, which may be summarized as follows:
 
a, Every station should be visible from the adjacent stations. Rays passing close to either the ground or to an obstacle should be avoided since they can be refracted due to air temperature diffirences.
b, The triangles formed thereby should be well-conditioned, that it to say, as nearly equilateral as possible. No angles should be less than 300, if at all possible. That scheme should be kept as simple as possible, but with sufficient redundant observations to provide the necessary checks and to increase precision.
c, The size of the triangles will depend on the configuration of the land, but they should normally be as large as possible compatible with the distinct bisection of signals, having regard to the type of the theodolite used.

Khu vực được bao phủ bởi đồ hình lưới tam giác cần phải được khảo sát một cách cẩn thận để chọn được những vị trí thích hợp nhất cho các trạm khống chế. Từ bản đồ có sẵn, đặc biệt là đường đồng mức, có thể có giá trị lớn do kích thước và hình dạng của tam giác được tạo bởi các trạm máy khó có thể nhìn thấy ngoài thực địa.
Khi bố trí đồ hình, chắc chắn là những vấn đề cần phải được quan tâm mà có thể được tổng kết như sau:
a, Mọi trạm máy nên được thông hướng với các trạm liền kề. Các tia ngắm không quá gần mặt đất hay qua chướng ngại vật bởi chúng có thể bị ảnh hưởng bởi chiết quang do nhiệt độ không khí khác nhau.
b, Hình thức của tam giác do đó nên được thành lập với điều kiện phù hợp, có nghĩa là, các cạnh gần như đều nhau đến mức có thể. Các góc không nên nhỏ hơn 300, nếu tất cả có thể. Đồ hình nên đơn giản, nhưng cần cung cấp trị đo thừa cho việc kiểm tra điều kiện và để tăng độ chính xác.
c, Độ lớn của tam giác sẽ được quyết định dựa vào hình dạng của khu vực đo, tuy nhiên, chúng nên càng lớn ở mức độ có thể càng tốt, tương ứng với tiêu ngắm của máy kinh vĩ, liên quan đến loại máy kinh vĩ mà ta sử dụng.

In surveying, the distance between two points is understood to mean the horizontal distance, regardless of the relative elevation of the points. In geodetic surveying, horizontal distances are reduced to the equivalent at sea level, but in plane surveying such reductions are unnecessary. Though frequently slope distances are measured, they are reduced to there equivalent on the horizontal projection for use in plotting maps, calculating land areas, ect.

Trong đo đạc, khoảng cách giữa hai điểm được hiểu có nghĩa là khoảng cách ngang, không quan tâm tới chênh cao giữa các điểm. Trong trắc địa cao cấp, khoảng cách ngang phải được tính chuyển về giá trị tương ứng so với mực nước biển, nhưng trong trắc địa phổ thông, việc quy chuyển là không cần thiết. Mặc dù khoảng cách nghiêng thường xuyên được đo, người ta vẫn đưa trị đo này về mặt chiếu ngang, để sử dụng trong việc vẽ bản đồ, tính toán diện tích đất, v.v.

2.	Bài đọc:
A major advance in surveying instrumentation was the development of electronic distance measuring instruments (EDM). These devices determine lengths by indirectly measuring the time it takes electromagnetic energy to travel from one end of a line to the other, and
 
return. The most common system for classifying EDM instruments is by the type of electromagnetic energy they transmit. Two categories are commonly employed in surveying-electro-optical instruments, which transmit either laser or infrared light; and microwave equipment, which transmit invisible electromagnetic energy of very short wavelength.
3.	Dịch:
Sự tiến bộ lớn của các thiết bị đo đạc trắc địa là việc phát triển các máy đo chiều dài điện tử. Những thiết bị này xác định chiều dài một cách gián tiếp bằng cách đo thời gian mà năng lượng điện từ đi từ một điểm cuối của đoạn thẳng tới điểm còn lại, rồi quay trở lại. Hệ thống phân loại các thiết bị EDM phổ biến nhất là theo loại năng lượng điện từ mà nó phát ra. Hai loại thông thường được sử dụng là thiết bị điện quang, truyền tín hiệu ở dạng tia laser hoặc tia hồng ngoại; và thiết bị sử dụng sóng ngắn, phát ra năng lượng điện từ không nhìn thấy được với bước sóng cực ngắn.

2.	Bài đọc:
The procedure of measuring a distance electronically is depicted in figure 3.3.a where an EDM device has been centered over station A by means of plumb bob or optical plummet.
 
Figure 3.3.a. Generalised EDM procedure
The instrument transmits a carrier signal of electronmagnetic energy to station B. A reference frequency of precisely regulated wavelength has been superimposed or modulated onto the carrier. The signal is returned from B to the receiver, so its travel part is double the slope distance AB. In the figure, the modulated electromagnetic energy is represented by a series of sine wave, each having wavelength λ. The unit a A determines the number of wavelength in the double part, multiples by the wavelength in metres and divides by two to obtain distance AB.

Figure 3.3.b. Phase diference measurement principle
 
It would of course be highly unusual if a measured distance was exactly an integral number of wavelengths, as illustrated in figure. Rather, some fractional part of a wavelength would in general be expected-for example, the partial value p shown in figure 3.3.b. In that figure, distance D between instrument and reflector would be expressed as:
L  n  p
2
In this equation, λ is the wavelength, n: the number or full wavelengths, and p: the length of the fraction part.

Hình 3.3.a. Nguyên lý tổng quát của máy toàn đạc điện tử.
Thiết bị này phát ra một sóng mang năng lượng điện từ tới trạm B. Tần số tham khảo ở A để bước sóng điều hòa chính xác được thêm vào hoặc được điều biến trên sóng tải. Tín hiệu trở lại từ B tới máy thu, do đó, nó đã di chuyển được một đoạn bằng hai lần khoảng cách nghiêng AB. Ở trên hình, năng lượng điện từ đã được điều biến được miêu tả bằng một dải sóng hình sin, mỗi cái có bước sóng là λ. Máy đo A xác định số bước sóng ở 2 lần khoảng cách, nhân với chiều dài bước sóng đo bằng mét, rồi chia cho 2 để có được khoảng cách AB.

Hình 3.3.b. Nguyên tắc đo khác
Rất đáng chú ý nếu một khoảng cách đo được là chính xác một số lượng bước sóng trọn vẹn, như minh họa ở trong hình. Đúng hơn, một vài
 
phần lẻ của 1 bước sóng nói chung là hoàn toàn có thể xảy ra – ví dụ như, phần giá trị p thể hiện trong hình 3.3.b. Trong hình này, khoảng cách D ở giữa máy và gương phản xạ sẽ được tính như sau:
L  n  p

Trong công thức này, λ là độ dài bước sóng, n là số nguyên lần bước sóng, và p là độ dài của phân lẻ.

Total station instrument (also called electronic tacheometers) combines an EDM instrument, electronic digital theodilite, and computer in one unit.
The electronic digital theodolite automatically measures and displays horizontal and vertical angels. Total station instrument simultaneously measures distance, as well as direction, and transmits the results automatically to a built-in computer. The horizontal and vertical angles and slope distance can be displayed; the upon keyboard commands, horizontal and vertical distance components are instantaneously computed and displayed.
If co-ordinates of the occupied station and a reference azimuth are input to the system, co-ordinates of the sighted point are immediately obtained. This information can all be directly stored in an automatic data collector, thereby eliminating manual recording. These instruments are of tremendous value in type of surveying.

2.	Bài đọc:
The	theodolite		is	an	instrument	designed	speacially	for		the measurement	of	horizontal		and	vertical	angles		in	surveying	and
 
construction work. It is the most versatile of surveying instrument, capable of performing in wide range of tasks. These include the measurement of horizontal and vertical angles, setting-out lines and angles, levelling, optical distance measurement, plumbing tall buildings and deep shafts, ect.
Horizontal and vertical angles are measured in the horizontal and vertical planes passing through the centre of a theodolite.
In most theodolites, the normal observing position is such that the vertical circle is at the observer’s left, and the observation is said to be face left or circle left. By rotating the telescope through 1800 in the vertical plane (i.e. about the trunnion axis), and then through 1800 in the horizontal plane, the telescope will again be pointing at the signal, but with the gunsights on the underside of the barrel, and the vertical circle to the right – i.e. the theodolite is in the face right or circle right position.

Nó là thiết bị đa năng nhất trong các thiết bị dùng trong trắc địa, có khả năng thực hiện các công việc trong phạm vi rộng lớn. Những công việc ấy bao gồm viêc đo góc ngang và góc đứng, bố trí cạnh và góc, đo thủy chuẩn, đo dài quang học, chiếu điểm lên các nhà cao tầng và xuống các giếng sâu, v.v.
Góc ngang và góc đứng được đo bằng mặt phẳng thẳng đứng và mặt phẳng ngang qua tâm của máy kinh vĩ.
Ở phần lớn máy kinh vĩ, thông thường vị trí quan sát ở bàn độ đứng bên trái của người đo, và trị đo đó được gọi là trị đo ở mặt trái hay bàn độ trái. Bằng việc đảo ống kính 1800 trong mặt phẳng thẳng đứng (nghĩa là trục quay ống kính), và sau đó quay 1800 ở mặt phẳng nằm ngang, ống kính sẽ lại được hướng về tiêu đo, nhưng với đầu ruồi ở mặt bên dưới của ống kính, và bàn độ đứng ở bên phải – nghĩa là máy kinh vĩ ở mặt phải hay vị trí bàn độ phải.

Station C	930 34’ 40”	2730 34’ 40”
Station A	010 15’ 20”	1810 15’ 40”
920 19’ 20”	920 19’ 00”
Mean value:	920 19’ 10”
Thus, two measurements of the angle are obtained during this set and their mean can be found. Further sets can be taken after changing the zero setting (a) by about 1800/n each time, n being the required number of sets.

2.	Bài đọc:
The angle of elevation (+) or depression (-) are measured with respect to the horizontal plane containing the trunnion axis of the instrument. After setting up over the station, the telescope is directed to one of the signal and exact coincidence on the mark obtained using both horizontal and vertical tangent screws. If a horizontal angle is being observed at the same time as a vertical angle the procedure discussed previously is adopted. Read the hook the vertical circle. If the instrument is not provided with an automic index, the altitude bubble should always be in the center of its run when reading the vertical circle. To eliminate the index error, a vertical angle should be observed on both faces of the instrument, the mean value giving the required vertical angle. However, a single measurement is enough in work such as tacheometry and contouring. When very accurate vertical angles are required, or for levelling, the index error and the altitude bubble should be adjusted.

Góc dương hay góc âm được đo cùng với giá trị của bàn độ ngang chứa trục quay ống kính của máy. Sau khi đặt máy ở mốc, ống kính hướng vào một trong hai tiêu đo và bắt chính xác vào lưới chỉ, sử dụng cả ốc vi động đứng và ngang. Nếu một góc ngang được đo đồng thời với góc đứng, thủ tục thảo luận ở phần trước được chấp nhận. Đọc số trên bàn độ đứng. Nếu thiết bị không có lưới chỉ tự động thì bọt thủy của ống thủy dọc sẽ luôn ở vị trí trung tâm khi đọc bàn độ đứng. Để loại trừ sai số MO, một góc đứng cần được đo bằng cả 2 vị trí bàn độ của máy, góc đứng yêu cầu là giá trị trung bình. Tuy nhiên, giá trị một vị trí bàn độ là đủ trong công việc như toàn đạc hay vẽ điah hình. Khi đòi hỏi góc đứng rất chính xác, hay cho đo cao, sai số MO và bọt thủy của ống thuỷ dọc cần phải được hiệu chỉnh.

2.	Bài đọc:
Levelling is the operation required in the determination or, more strickly, the comparision, of heights of points on the surface of the Earth. If a whole series of heights is given relative to a plane, this plane is called a datum.
In topographical work, the datum is used in the mean level of the sea. The basic equipment required in levelling is:
-	A device which gives a truly horizontal line (the Level)
-	A suitably graduated staff for reading vertical heights (the Levelling staff)
The levelling device must be set up so that its longitudinal axis is at right angles to the direction of gravity (i.e. the line taken by a plimb bob), and the line of sight will then be horizontal, assuming the instrument to be in correct adjustment. There are two adjustments required:
-	The bubble-tube axis must be set perpendicular to the vertical axis.
-	The line of collimation must be parallel to the bubble-axis.

Đo thủy chuẩn là một hoạt động mang tính bắt buộc trong việc xác định hay, nói


 
Sv:Vũ Duy Đông
 
một cách chính xác hơn, là sự so sánh độ cao của các điểm trên bề mặt Trái đất. Nếu toàn bộ độ cao được so sánh cho gần với một mặt phẳng, thì mặt đó được gọi là mặt thủy chuẩn.
Trong công tác đo đạc địa hình, mặt thủy chuẩn được sử dụng là mặt trung bình của mặt nước biển.
Thiết bị cơ bản đòi hỏi trong đo thủy chuẩn là:
-	Một thiết bị tạo ra tia ngắm nằm ngang (máy thủy chuẩn)
-	Một mia khắc vạch một cách phù hợp để đọc độ cao đứng (mia thủy chuẩn)
Thiết bị đo thủy chuẩn phải được thiết lập sao cho trục dọc của nó phải vuông gócg với hướng của trọng lực (có nghĩa là đường dây dọi), và khi đó tia ngắm sẽ nằm ngang, và máy sẽ được xem như đã được điều chỉnh chính xác. Có hai thao tác trong việc cân bằng:
-	trục ống thủy phải được đặt vuông góc với trục đứng của máy.
-	tia ngắm nằm ngang phải song song với trục ống thủy.
5.1.	PROCEDURE IN LEVELLING:
1.	Từ mới:
•	Respectively: [ris'pektivli]: adv: tách biệt ra; theo thứ tự định sẵn, lần lượt
2.	Bài đọc:
The basic operation is determination of the difference in level between two points. Consider two points A and B as shown in figure 5.1. Set up the level, assumed to be in perfect adjustment, so that readings may be made on a staff held vertically on A or B in return. If the readings on A and B are 3.222m and 1.414m respectively (fig. 5.1.a), then the difference in level between A and B is equal to AC, i.e. 3.222 – 1.414 = 1.808 m, and this represents a rise in height of the land at B relative to A. If the reading at B is greater than at A (fig. 5.1.b), say 3.484m, then the difference in level would be 3.222 – 3.484 = -0.262m, and this would represent a fall in the height of the land at B relative A. Thus, we have that in any two successive staff readings:
2nd reading less than 1st represents a rise 2nd reading greater than 1st represents a fall
 
If the actual level of one of the two points is known, the level of the other may be found by either adding the rise or subtracting the fall, e.g. if the level at A is 128.480 m above datum then:
a.	Level at B = Level at A + Rise
= 128.480 + 1.808 = 130.288 m above datum
b.	Level at B = Level at A – Fall
= 128.480 – 0.262 = 128.218 m above datum
3.	Dịch:
Thao tác đo thủy chuẩn:
Thao tác cơ bản là việc xác định chênh cao giữa 2 điểm. Xét 2 điểm A và B như trong hình 5.1. Thiết lập trạm máy, giả sử như đã được cân bằng chính xác, các số đọc có thể được thực hiện trên một mia được dựng thẳng đứng ở A hay B. Nếu số đọc ở A và B lần lượt là 3.222m và 1.414m (hình 5.1.a), thì chênh cao giữa A và B là AC, có nghĩa là 3.222 - 1.414 = 1.808m, và điều này diễn tả sự tăng độ cao của mặt đất ở B so với A. Nếu số đọc ở B lớn hơn số đọc ở A (hình 5.1.b), ví dụ như 3.484m, thì chênh cao sẽ phải là: 3.222 - 3.848 = -0.262m, và điều này diễn tả sự giảm độ cao mặt đất của B so với A. Như vậy, ở hai số đọc trên mia liên tiếp:
-	nếu số đọc mia 2 nhỏ hơn mia 1 thì diễn tả chênh cao tăng
-	nếu số đọc mia 2 lớn hơn mia 1 thì diễn tả chênh cao giảm.
Nếu độ cao thực tế của 1 trong 2 điểm đã biết, thì độ cao điểm còn lại có thể tìm được bằng cách cộng thêm chênh cao tăng hay trừ đi chênh cao giảm, ví dụ, nếu độ cao ở A là 128.480m so với mặt thủy chuẩn thì:
a, độ cao ở B = độ cao ở A cộng với phần tăng b, độ cao ở B = độ cao ở A trừ đi phần giảm

2.	Bài đọc:
A example of such a section has been given in fig. 5.2 from which it will be seen that the object is to reproduce on paper the existing ground profile along a particular line – often, though not invariably, the center line of existing or proposed work, e.g the center line of railway, road or
 
canal. Staff reading to 0.01 m should be generally adequate for this purpose.
The accuracy with which the ground profile is represented on the section is dependent on the distance between staff stations, and this in turn depends on the scale of the section. As a general basis, however, levels should be taken at:
-	Every 20m.
-	Points at which the gradient changes, e.g top and bottom of banks.
-	Edges of natural features such as ditches, ponds, ECT.
The sections are usually plotted to a distorted scale, a common one for roadwork being 1/500 scale horizontal and 1/100 vertical.
The following points should be borne in mind during the actual levelling, particularly when levelling long section, to avoid build up of error:
-	Start the work from a benchmark if possible, and make use of any nearby bench marks, which lie within the length being leveled.
-	Try to keep backsights and foresights equal in length to minimize errors which will occur if the line of collimation is not parallel to bubble- tube axis.
-	Take the final foresight on a bench mark or, better, close back on the starting point.

Một ví dụ về mặt cắt dọc được thể hiện ở hình 5.2, mà ở đó, nó sẽ thực hiện mục đích là thể hiện trên giấy bản vẽ mặt đất tự nhiên dọc theo những đường đặc biệt, mặc dù không phải luôn luôn là như vậy, tim đường của những công trình đã có hoặc công trình đề xuất, ví dụ như trục đường xe lửa, đường giao thông hay kênh mương. Số đọc trên mia đến 0.01m nhìn chung là phù hợp với mục đích trên.
Độ chính xác của hình ảnh mặt đất được miêu tả trên mặt cắt là phụ thuộc vào khoảng cách giữa hai điểm đặt mia, và theo đó phụ thuộc vào tỉ lệ của mặt cắt. Tuy nhiên, về cơ bản, độ cao cần được thể hiện:
-	Mỗi khoảng cách 20m.
-	Các điểm có sự thay đổi độ dốc, như đỉnh và đáy của bờ sông.
-	Cạnh của các đối tượng tự nhiên như rãnh nước, ao, v.v
Mặt cắt thường được vẽ với tỉ lệ khác nhau, một tỉ lệ thông thường cho đường giao thônglà 1/500 với tỉ lệ ngang và 1/100 với tỉ lệ đứng.
 
Những điểm sau cần phải được chú ý trong suốt quá trình đo thủy chuẩn thực tế, đặc biệt là khi đo thủy chuẩn mặt cắt dài, để nhằm tránh việc tạo ra các sai số:
-	Bắt đầu công việc từ điểm mốc độ cao Nhà nước nếu có thể, sử dụng tất cả các mốc bất kì gần đó nằm trong giới hạn đo đạc.
-	Cố gắng giữ cho chiều dài tia ngắm trước bằng tia ngắm sau để cho sai số là tối thiểu, cái mà sẽ xảy ra nếu tia ngắm nằm ngang không song song với trục ống thủy.
-	Thực hiện tia ngắm trước cuối cùng về mốc độ cao Nhà nước, hay, tốt hơn, khép nó về điểm bắt đầu.

•	Judicious: [dʒu:'di∫əs]: adj: đúng đắn, sáng suốt
2.	Bài đọc:
Works of narrow width such as sewers and pipelines require only one line of levels along the center line of the proposed trench, since there will generally be little change of the ground surface level over the proposed width. Wider work, however, such as roads, railways, embankments, ECT, will necessitate the use of ground on either side of the center line and information regarding relative ground levels is obtained by taking cross- sections at right angles to the center line. The longitudinal spacing of the sections depends on the nature of the ground, but should be constant if earthworks are to be computed. A spacing of 20m is common.
 
It is common to plot cross-section to natural, i.e undistorted, scale and, since only the ground profile and a limited depth are required, the plots can be kept compact by judicious choice of datum or base height.
3.	Dịch:
Những công việc trên phạm vi hẹp như cống rãnh hay đường ống dẫn chỉ yêu cầu một đường thủy chuẩn dọc theo tim đường của rãnh mương, do nhìn chung chỉ có một chút thay đổi của độ cao mặt đất trong phạm vi đề xuất. Tuy nhiên, ở những công trình rộng lớn hơn như đường gia thông, đường sắt, đê đắp cao,... sẽ cần thiết sự sử dụng trên mặt đất cả các cạnh của trục đường và các thông tin yêu cầu liên quan độ cao tương đối của mặt đất được thu nhận bởi mặt cắt ngang ở góc vuông của trục đường. Khoảng cách của mặt cắt ngang phụ thuộc vào các đặc tính của mặt đất tự nhiên, nhưng nó nên được giữ nguyên không thay đổi nếu công việc đào đắp được yêu cầu để tính toán. Thông thường khoảng cách là 20m.
Thông thường, mặt cắt ngang được vẽ một cách tự nhiên, có nghĩa là không sử dụng tỉ lệ, và do chỉ có bề mặt tự nhiên và độ sâu giới hạn được yêu cầu, bản vẽ cần được thực hiện với việc lựa chọn đúng mặt thủy chuẩn hay độ cao chuẩn.

•	Circuit: ['sə:kit]: n: chu vi, đường vòng quanh
2.	Bài đọc:
A contour is a line joining points of equal altitude. Contours lines are shown on plans as dotted lines, often in distinctive colour, overlaying the
 
details. The vertical distance between successive contours is known as the vertical interval, and the value of this depends on the scale of the plan and the use to which the plan is to be put. For example, a 1/5000 plan prepared by photogrammetric methods for the planning of highway project may have contours at 5m intervals.
As regards the interpretation of contours, when they are close together, steep gradients exist, and as they open, the gradients flatten. A contour line must make a closed circuit even though not within the area covered by the plan.

Đường đồng mức là một đường nối liền các điểm có cùng độ cao. Đường đồng mức được thể hiện trên bản vẽ bằng đường nét đứt, thường được phân biệt bằng màu sắc, chồng phủ về mặt chi tiết. Khoảng cách đứng giữa 2 đường đồng mức liên tiếp được gọi là khoảng cao đều, và giá trị của nó quyết định trên tỉ lệ của bản vẽ, và với sử dụng nó. Ví dụ, một bản vẽ 1/5000 được thành lập bởi phương pháp ảnh số phục vụ cho dự án đường cao tốc có thể có đường đồng mức có khoảng cao đều là 5m.
Có liên quan đến phép nội suy đường đồng mức, khi chúng lại gần nhau, tồn tại dốc đứng, và nếu chúng xa nhau, địa hình tương đối bằng phẳng. Một đường đồng mức nên tạo thành một đường trơn khép kín mặc dù không giới hạn khu vực bao phủ bởi bản vẽ.

EXERCISE:
1.	What is the purpose of levelling?
Levelling is the operation required in the determination or, more strictly, the comparison, of heights of points on the surface of the Earth.
2.	Which is the basic equipment required in levelling? The basic equipment required in levelling is:
-	A device which give a truly horizontal line (the Level)
-	A suitable graduated staff for reading vertical heights (the Levelling Staff)
3.	How must the levelling device be set up?
The levelling device must be set up so that its longitudinal axis is at right angles to the direction of gravity, and the line of sight will then be horizontal, assuming the instrument to be in correct adjustment.
4.	Which adjustments of the level are required? There are 2 adjustment required:
-	The bubble-tube axis must be set perpendicular to the vertical axis.
-	The line of collimation must be parallel to the bubble-axis.
5.	Describe the procedure in levelling?
The basic operation is determination of the difference in level between two points. Consider two points A and B as shown in figure 5.1. Set up the level, assumed to be in perfect adjustment, so that readings may be made on a staff held vertically on A or B in return. If the readings on A and B are 3.222m and 1.414m respectively (fig 5.1.a), then the difference in level between A and B is equal to AC, i.e. 3.222-1.414 = 1.808m, and this represents a rise in height of the land at B relative to A. If the reading at B is greater than at A (fig 5.1.b), say 3.484m, then the difference in level would be 3.222-3.484 = -0.262m, and this would represent a fall in the height of the land at B relative A.
6.	Mention the uses of levelling? The uses of levelling:
-	Determining the difference in level between two points
-	The taking of longitudinal sections.
 
-	Cross-section
-	Contouring
-	Setting out levels.
7.	How should the levels be taken to establish the longitudinal sections? Levels should be taken at:
-	Every 20m
-	Points at which the gradient changes, e.g. top and bottom of banks.
-	Edges of natural features such as ditches, ponds, act.
8.	To avoid the buildup of error, what should one bear in mind?
To avoid the buildup of error, the following points should be borne in mind:
-	Start the work from a benchmark if possible, and make use of any nearby benchmark, which lie within the length being leveled.
-	Try to keep backsights and foresights equal in length to minimize errors which will occur if the line of collimation is not parallel to bubble- tube axis.
-	Take the final foresight on the benchmark or, better, close back on the starting point.

2.	Bài đọc:
Traversing is a method of control survey. A series of control points (stations) each one being intervisible with its adjacent stations, will be chosen to fufill the demands of the survey, the lines joining these stations being the traverse lines. The survey then consists of the measurement of angles between successive lines and the length of each line. Given the co- ordinates of the first station and the bearing of the first line, the co- ordinates of all successive points can be calculated.
If the figure formed by the lines closes at a sation, i.e. if they form a polygon or it starts and finishes at points of known co-ordinates, then a closed traverse has been obtained, the two being distinguished as a closed loop traverse and a closed line traverse: A traverse starting at, say, station A and ending at E which has not been co-ordinated previously, is called an
 
unclosed traverse. Each type has its particular uses, but the closed traverse is the more satisfactory figure since it is the easiest one to which to apply corrections for the errors which invariably occur.
The unclosed traverse survey can be carried out when the survey is comparatively long and harrow, such as that required for a trunk sewer, pipeline, main trunk road or rail construction.
A closed traverse survey may be used for framework or surveys for housing or factory sites, and determination of the perimeters of lakes, etc. They may also have to be undertaken when setting out shafts to tunnels which are being driven under build-up areas. The closed line traverse has the advantage over the closed loop traverse in that mistakes in the finishing co-ordinates and bearing should be revealed.
Traverse types are often indentified by either the equipment used or their accuracy. A first-order traverse might have leg lengths of up to 50 km measured by microwave EDM and angles measured by a precise theodolite, e.g Wild T3. On small sites, or in urban areas where visibility is greatly restricted, leg lengths may be up to 250 m and measurement could be by EDM or steel tape. The angles of the traverse might be measured with a theodolite reading to 20 seconds.

Đường chuyền đa giác là một phương pháp khống chế trắc địa. Một loạt các điểm khống chế (các trạm máy), mỗi điểm phải thông hướng với các điểm liền kề nó, sẽ được chọn để thỏa mãn các yêu cầu của công tác đo đạc, các cạnh nối các điểm đó tạo thành cạnh đường chuyền. Công tác đo đạc bao gồm đo góc giữa các cạnh liên tiếp và chiều dài mỗi cạnh. Nếu cho tọa độ của điểm đầu tiên và phương vị của cạnh đầu, ta có thể tính ra tọa độ của tất cả các điểm liên tiếp.
Nếu đồ hình có dạng các cạnh khép kín tại một điểm, có nghĩa là nếu chúng tạo thành một đa giác, hay nó bắt đầu và kết thúc tại những điểm đã biết tọa độ, ta sẽ thu được đường chuyền khép kín. Có 2 loại đường chuyền là đường chuyền khép kín và đường chuyền phù hợp. một đường chuyền bắt đầu tại A và kết thúc tại E mà tọa độ chưa được xác định thì được gọi là đường chuyền treo. Mỗi dạng có những ứng dụng riêng của nó, nhưng đường chuyền khép kín là đồ hình phù hợp hơn, vì nó dễ dàng nhất trong việc áp dụng việc hiệu chỉnh sai số có thể xảy ra.
 
Đường chuyền treo có thể được thực hiện khi đo đạc những khu vực tương đối dài và hẹp, như là yêu cầu về cống rãnh, đường ống dẫn, tuyến đường chính hay xây dựng đường sắt.
Đường chuyền khép kín được sử dụng trong lưới cơ sở hay đo đạc ở khu vực nhà ở hay vị trí các nhà máy, và xác định chu vi của các hồ,... Chúng cũng có thể được thực hiện khi bố trí các hầm lò, đường hầm chạy dưới khu vực xây dựng. Đường chuyền phù hợp có ưu điểm hơn đường chuyền khép kín ở chỗ sai số của tọa độ điểm cuối và phương vị cuối được phát hiện.
Các dạng đường chuyền được nhận biết bởi cả thiết bị sử dụng hay độ chính xác của chúng. Đường chuyền hạng I có thể có chuyền dài cạnh lên tới 50km, được đo bởi máy đo dài điện tử sóng ngắn và góc được đo bởi máy kinh vĩ chính xác, ví dụ như Wild T3. Ở khu vực nhỏ, hay khu vực đô thị, nơi tầm thông hướng bị hạn chế đáng kể, chiều dài cạnh có thể là 250m và được đo bởi máy đo dài điện tử hay thước thép. Các góc của đường chuyền có thể được đo bằng máy kinh vĩ có độ chính xác đọc số là 20”.

The stations should be chosen with the requirements of the survey in mind, aiming for good visibility between stations and bearing in mind any subsequent setting out. When survey land for a housing site, for instance, the traverse lines will be used for picking up much of the detail to be plotted, so that they will follow the perimeter of the site. The legs should be of approximately equal length and it is suggested that no traverse
 
should contain more than ten legs before closing, whenever possible. Stations when chosen should be placed in such a way that there will be no displacement.

2.	Bài đọc:
Staring with the known or assumed bearing of one line, the whole- circle bearings of all other lines must be determined.
Referring to fig 6.2 the mean internal angles are found to be θA, θB, ect, while the whole-circle bearing of AB has been determined as αAB. Conditions at B, fig 6.2 are reproduced in fig 6.4, the dotted line through being the north-south meridian NBS.
Therefore: αBC = αAB + θB – 180o
 
i.e. the whole-circle bearing of BC is given by the sum of the whole- circle bearing of AB and the internal angle at B minus 180o. Inspection of C shows that the whole-circle bearing of CD, which equals αCD is given by the sum of the whole-circle bearing of BC (αBC) and the internal angle at C (θC) plus 180o. To summarize, then, for the general case, to determine the whole-circle bearing of line at a station:
-	Add the included angle at the station to the whole-circle bearing of the previous line.
-	If the sum obtained is below 180o, then add 180o to it (i.e. as for line CD)
-	If the sum exceeds 180o, then reduct 180o from it (i.e. as for line BC)
3.	Dịch:
Xuất phát từ phương vị đã biết hoặc phương vị giả định của một cạnh, ta có thể xác định được phương vị của tất cả các cạnh khác.
Tham khảo hình 6.2, các góc trong đo được là θA, θB, ... với góc phương vị của AB được xác định là αAB. Điều kiện tại B, hình 6.2 được thể hiện ở hình 6.4, các đường đánh dấu chấm qua kinh tuyến Bắc Nam.
Vì vậy: αAB = θA + θB -1800, có nghĩa là phương vị ở BC được đưa ra bằng tổng của góc phương vị AB và góc trong tại B trừ đi 1800. Xét tại điểm C ta thấy phương vị của CD là αCD bằng tổng của phương vị BC và góc trong tại C cộng với 1800. Tổng kết lại, trong trường hợp tổng quát, để xác định tọa độ một cạnh tại một trạm máy ta làm như sau:
-	Cộng giá trị góc trong của trạm máy với phương vị cạnh trước.
-	Nếu tổng thu được nhỏ hơn 1800 thì cộng thêm 1800 vào nó (như cạnh CD).
-	nếu tổng thu được lớn hơn 1800 thì trừ đi 1800 từ tổng đó (như cạnh BC).

In the position reached the lengths of the lines are known, the internal angles have been measured and adjusted, and whole-circle bearings have
 
been calculated. The co-ordinates are derived form easting and northing differences. Thus, the next step is to calculate the easting and northing differences for each line of the traverse.
ΔE = 1 sinα ΔN = 1 cosα
Great care must be taken with the signs of the diffirrences since some will be positive and some negative.
Since this traverse is in the form of a closed loop, the algebraic sum of all the easting diffirences and all the northing differences should be zero.
I.e. the traverse should finish where it started. It can be seen that this is not the case, the closing errors in the easting and northing directions being dE and dN.

Ở điểm đầu của cạnh đã biết chiều dài, các góc trong được đo và bình sai, và các góc phương vị được tính toán. Tọa độ thu được từ gia số tọa độ X và Y. Do vậy bước tiếp theo là tính gia số tọa độ của mỗi cạnh của đường chuyền theo công thức:	ΔE = l sinα
ΔN = l cosα
Cần phải chú ý dấu của các gia số tọa độ vì chúng có thể âm hoặc dương.
Do đường chuyền có dạng là đường chuyền khép kín, nên tổng đại số của các gia số tọa độ X và Y phải bằng 0, nghĩa là đường chuyền phải kết thúc ở điểm bắt đầu. Có thể trường hợp này không xảy ra, khi đó sai số khép của hướng X và Y là dE và dN.

Global Positioning System (GPS) technology is a branch science of Space Geodesy. The launch of the 1st artificial satellite on October 4th, 1975 results in a new era of Geodesy. The satellite Geodesy that makes use of the signals transmitted by satellites to survey and describe the Earth came into being in the mid 1960’s.
The GPS system consists of 3 major segments:
-	A space segment, NAVSTAR satellites that transmit radio signals (simplified as GPS signals) to navigation and positioning users;
-	A control segment, ground-based equipment to monitor operation states of GPS in-orbit satellites and update GPS signals;
-	A user segment, GPS receiver that can receive passively, track, convert and survey GPS signals to determine three-dimensional position, velocity, and time for land, sea and airborne users anywhere in the world with unprecedented accuracy, even three-dimensional attitude parameters of a motional carrier.
Figure 7.1 summarizes the configuration and operational bases of above three segments.

After launching the first test GPS satellite on February 22th, 1978 the engineering development phase came into operation.
 
At present, twenty-six operation satellites in orbits can provide the navigation and positioning service for military and civilian users. According to the original plan, the GPS constellation contains 21 operation satellites plus 3 in-orbit spares (fig.7.2)
The operation satellites are arrayed in 6 orbit planes inclined 55 degrees to the equator. Each orbit is circular with the nominal altitude of 20,200km, corresponding to about 26,600km for the semimajor axis. The corresponding orbital period is twelve sidereal hour, one half of the Earth’s period of rotation. Each satellite transmits two frequency signals for navigation and positioning: L1 on 1575.42 MHz and L2 on 1227.60 MHz. The carrier signals are modulated by two pseudo-random noise (PRN) codes and a navigation message that includes a predicted satellites ephemeris, atmospheric propagation correction data, satellite clock error information and satellite health data.

The control segment includes a master control station (MCS) at the consolidated Space Operation Center at Colorado Spring, and a number of monitor stations, located throughout the world, such as the stations on Diego Garcia, Ascension Island, Kwajalein and Hawaii (Fig. 7.3).
The purpose of control segment is to monitor the health of GPS satellites, determine their orbits and behavior of their atomic clocks, and inject the broadcast message into GPS satellites. The monitor stations passively track GPS satellites, gather ranging data from GPS signals and relay them to the MCS where they are processed to determine satellite position and signal data accuracy. The MCS updates the navigation message (simplified D-code) of each satellite and relays this information to the ground injecting stations that transmit it to GPS satellites. The Ground injecting stations are also used to transmit and receive satellite control information.

Mục đích của đoạn điều khiển là theo dõi tình trạng vệ tinh, xác định quỹ đạo của chúng và các phản ứng của đồng hồ nguyên tử, và truyền các thông tin đạo hàng đến các vệ tinh GPS. Các trạm quan trắc theo dõi bị động vệ tinh GPS, tập hợp các loại dữ liệu từ tín hiệu vệ tinh và truyền chúng tới trạm điều khiển trung tâm, nơi chúng được xử lí để xác định vị trí vệ tinh và độ chính xác của các dữ liệu của tín hiệu. Trạm điều khiển trung tâm cập nhật thông tin đạo hàng (gọi tắt là D-code) của mỗi vệ tinh và truyền các thông tin này tới trạm thu mặt đất để truyền nó tới vệ tinh GPS.

2.	Bài đọc:
The user segment includes static and kinematic receivers designed to different requirements of all military and civilian users. The static receivers are used to determine fixed point positions where receiver antennas do not move in respect to the Earth. The kinematic receivers are used to determine motional carrier positions and velocities, even attitude parameters, that is, GPS kinematic measurements imply that receiver antennas are motional in spect to the Earth. The bodies build-in with GPS receivers are defined as motional carriers, such as vehicle, ship, and low- orbit spacecrafts. According to a different speed of the motional carrier, the GPS kinematic measurements are divided into 3 modes of low, mid and high states. The speed per second of the low mode is of several meters; one hundred meters to hundreds of meters for the mid mode; and several kilometers for high mode. Since the first commercial GPS receivers for Earth surveying came into being in December 1982, GPS receivers have being fast developed and extensively used by many countries. For example, U.S Forces used 17,000 GPS receivers during the Gulf War in 1991. The U.S Secretary of Defense, Mr. Richard Cheny made the following comment in a report to U.S Congress, “The NAVSTAR GPS played a vital role in the overall operation. The VII corps sweep across the Western Desert was not expected by the Iraqis because of the lack of terrain features and could not have accomplished without GPS”.

Đoạn sử dụng bao gồm máy thu tĩnh và động được thiết kế cho nhiều yêu cầu khác nhau, phục vụ cho quân sự và dân sự. Máy thu tĩnh được sử dụng để xác định vị trí điểm cố định nơi ăngten thu không thể di chuyển trên bề mặt đất. Máy thu động được sử dụng để xác định vị trí của vật thể bạy, vận tốc, thậm chí cả các tham số vị trí, do đó, các trị đo GPS động với danh nghĩa là các máy thu GPS chuyển động trên bề mặt Trái đất. Khối được thiết lập với các máy thu GPS được định nghĩa như các thiết bị chuyển động, như là xe cộ, tàu thuyền và các tàu vũ trụ quỹ đạo thấp. Tùy theo vận tốc khác nhau của các thiết bị chuyển động, trị đo GPS động có thể được chia ra 3 mứa độ chậm, trung bình và nhanh. Tốc độ mỗi giây ở phương thức chậm là vài mét; 1000 tới vài trăm mét với phương thức trung bình; và vài kilomet với phương thức nhanh. Kể từ khi các thiết bị GPS thương mại đầu tiên để đo mặt đất được đưa vào sử dụng vào 12/1982, các máy thu GPS đã có bước phát triển nhaqnh chóng và được sử dụng rộng rãi ở nhiều quốc gia. Ví dụ như quân đội Mĩ đã sử dụng 17,000 máy thu GPS trong suốt cuộc chiến tranh vùng Vịnh năm 1991. Thư kí của Bộ quốc phòng Mĩ, ông Richard Cheny đã đưa ra lời nhận xét sau trong bản báo cáo gửi lên Quốc hội Mĩ: “GPS đóng vai trò sống còn trong toàn bộ hoạt động. Quân đoàn VII đã càn quét dọc theo Sa mạc phía Tây mà không bị người I-rắc phát hiện bởi ở đó thiếu các thông tin địa hình và đã có thể không hoàn thành được nếu không có GPS”.

2.	Bài đọc:
The static positioning is used to determine the position of a stationary antenna relative to the Earth. GPS positioning bases on simultaneously surveying the distances from the receiver’s antenna to each of several GPS satellites. The measured distances are surveyed by the following methods:
-	Pseudo range measurements with C/A-code and/or P-code;
-	Carrier phase measurements;
 
-	Combination with pseudo range and carrier phase measurements (for surveying the distances, not only to use PRN code, but also to use carrier phase).
-	For Earth surveying, the people do not use alone the pseudo range measurements, but make use of the combination with both the pseudo range and carrier phase measurements, so as to obtain a high accuracy for GPS positioning. At present, there is a developing trend to use the combination of the pseudo range and carrier phase measurements.

Phương pháp định vị tĩnh được sử dụng để xác định vị trí tương hỗ của các ăngten thu cố định so với Trái đất. Định vị GPS dựa vào việc đo đồng thời khoảng cách từ các ăng ten thu tới các vệ tinh khác nhau. Khoảng cách đo được được đo theo các phương pháp sau:
-	Đo khoảng cách giả sử dụng mã C/A và/hoặc mã P.
-	Đo pha sóng tải
-	Kết hợp đo khoảng cách giả và pha sóng tải (để đo khoảng cách, không chỉ sử dụng mã PRN mà còn sử dụng pha sóng tải).
-	Trong đo đạc mặt đất, người ta không sử dụng riêng khoảng cách giả mà người ta sử dụng kết hợp vả khoảng cách giả và pha sóng tải, do đó đạt được độ chính xác cao trong định vị GPS. Hiện nay, có một xu hướng đang phát triển là sử dụng kết hợp giữa khoảng cách giả và trị đo pha sóng tải.

2.	Bài đọc:
So-called GPS kinematic surveying is the real-time measurements in that the position, velocity and attitude of a receiver’s antenna vary with the movement of a motional carrier. Versus the GPS static positioning, the GPS kinematic surveying has the following features:
 
-	Different motional carrier, such as the vehicles driven on the land, the ships navigated on the water-surface, air- and space-craft;
-	Different navigation speed, such as 800m per minute for truck, 1.5km per minute for train, 30km per minute for aircraft, 440km per minute for satellites at the altitude of 800km.
-	Different accuracy requirement form tens of meters to a few centimeters;
-	Fast measurements for real- time positions and velocities, such as updated data rates of 1, 0.5, 0.1 and 0.02 second.
DGPS with the pseudo range.
Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) can be used effectively to reduce the accuracy loss of SA techniques on GPS measurements. When performing DGPS surveying it is necessary to have two GPS receivers installed respectively on a reference station and motional carrier. There are two modes for DGPS surveying:
-	Real-time calibration by means of a correction transmission from the reference station to kinematic users so as acquire accurately real-time positions of the motional carrier.
-	Post-processing combination made use of GPS data of simultaneous measurements from the reference station and kinematic user for data processing in an office.

2.	Bài đọc:
Regardless of their purpose of kind, maps are usually so plotted features are shown in the same relative location that they occupy on the ground, at a given scale. Hence the data of a survey furnish the information that is necessary to plot the map, and the operations of plotting are in a sense the reverse of the operations of surveying.
In general, the process of mapping involves the plotting, by more precise method, of points of horizontal control which are generally transmit stations and which may be traverse points, triangulation points, or both, and the plotting, by less precise methods of features to these details being given in the form of angles and distances from the lines and points in the horizontal control system. The map complilation is made on a table called coordinatograph.
Most maps are plotted wholly in the office from data taken in the fields, but where conditions are favourable and the objects to be shown are numerous, maps are often plotted more expeditiously in the field as the survey progresses. As a general rule, the points of primary horizontal control are plotted in the office, but often when details are mapped in the field, points of secondary horizontal control are fixed on the ground only as it becomes necessary to establish such points to expedite the location of details.
Today, maps may be also made from photographs owing to the advances made in the application of stereoscopic photography (two pictures of the same area from different viewpoints), principally in vertical photographs taken from an aircraft. This method permits the visual reconstruction of a three-dimensional image of the area viewed. The production of accurate maps from the stereoscopic study and analysis of air photographs is the province of a photogrammetric specialist. Aerial survey and mapping requires the use of very large complex and expensive plotting machines (e.g Autograph – a precision plotter for aerial and terrestrial photographs at all scale), but air survey provides the only possible means of mapping large developed areas of the world.
3.	Dịch: Quá trình thành lập bản đồ:
 
Bất kể với mục đích nào đi nữa, bản đồ thường để vẽ các đặc trưng được thể hiện ở mối tương quan vị trí điểm trên mặt đất, với một tỉ lệ nhất định. Do đó, các dữ liệu đo đạc cung cấp thông tin cần thiết để đo vẽ bản đồ, và công việc đo vẽ diễn ra theo chiều hướng ngược lại với quá trình đo đạc.
Thông thường, quá trình thành lập bản đồ bao gồm việc đo vẽ, với các phương pháp chính xác hơn, các điểm khống chế mặt bằng, cái mà thường được truyền từ các trạm và có thể là điểm đường chuyền, lưới tam giác, hoặc cả hai, và việc đo vẽ, với độ chính xác thấp hơn, các điểm chi tiết đặc trưng được đưa ra từ các góc, khoảng cách từ các cạnh và điểm của lưới khống chế mặt bằng. Việc biên tập bản đồ được thực hiện trên một bàn được gọi là máy chuyển tọa độ.
Phần lớn bản đồ được vẽ toàn bộ trong phòng từ các dữ liệu đo đạc ngoài thực địa, nhưng ở những nơi có điều kiện thuận lợi và đối tượng được thể hiện nhiều, bản đồ thường được vẽ nhanh hơn ở những khu vực tiến hành đo đạc. Nguyên tắc chung, các điểm khống chế mặt bằng cấp I được vẽ ở trong phòng, nhưng thường các chi tiết được vẽ ngoài thực địa, các điểm khống chế mặt bằng cấp II được đánh dấu trên mặt đất chỉ khi nó trở nên cần thiết để thành lập vị trí các điểm chi tiết.
Ngày nay, bản đồ cũng có thể được thành lập từ các ảnh do những tiến bộ trong việc ứng dụng của phương pháp đo ảnh lập thể (hai ảnh chụp cùng một vùng với hai tâm chụp khác nhau), phần lớn là ảnh thẳng đứng được chụp từ máy bay. Phương pháp này cho phép dựng lại ảnh không gian ba chiều của khu vực chụp. Sản phẩm của bản đồ chính xác từ sự nghiên cứu và phân tích lập thể của ảnh hàng không là lĩnh vực của các chuyên gia ảnh. Đo đạc trên không và thành lập bản đồ yêu cầu việc sử dụng các thiết bị đo vẽ rất phức tạp và đắt tiền (như Autograph – một máy đo vẽ chính xác phục vụ cho đo ảnh trên không và trên mặt đất ở tất cả các tỷ lệ), nhưng đo đạc trên không chỉ có thể đo vẽ các vùng rộng lớn trên thế giới.

Explanatory notes or legends are often of assistance in interpreting a drawing. They should be as brief as circumstances will follow, but at the same time should include sufficient information as to leave no doubt in the mind of the person using the drawing. A key to the symbols representing various details ought to be shown unless the symbols are conventional in character: the nature and sources of data upon which the drawing is based ought sometime to be made known. For example, the data for a map may be obtained from several sources, perhaps partly from old maps partly from old survey notes, and partly from new surveys; the meridian has been determined by astronomical observation; and elevations are referred to a certain datum as indicated by a certain bench mark of a previous survey.

Chú thích và chú giải thường giúp đỡ trong việc thể hiện một bản vẽ. Chúng nên vắn tắt ở mức độ chi tiết cho phép, nhưng ở cùng một thời điểm bao gồm đủ thông tin để tránh sự nhầm lẫn với người sử dụng bản vẽ. Một biểu tượng trình bày lại các điểm chi tiết một cách đa dạng phải được thể hiện bằng kí hiệu, thông thường là bằng các chữ cái: thông tin tự nhiên và nguồn gốc của các thông tin, cái mà bản vẽ dựa vào, đôi lúc phải được biết. Ví dụ, thông tin của một bản đồ có thể được sử dụng từ một vài nguồn, có thể một phần từ các bản đồ cũ, một phần từ các chú thích trắc địa cũ, và một phần từ việc đo vẽ mới; kinh tuyến được xác định bởi các trị đo thiên văn; và độ cao được chuyển từ một mặt thủy chuẩn nào đó được biểu thị bởi một điểm gốc của việc đo đạc trước đó.

Surveying is the science of determining the relative positions of objects or points on the earth’s surface. These points may be any physical thing: a highway, culvert, ditch, storm drain inlet, or property corner. Distances and directions determine the horizontal positions of these points. The vertical positions are determined by differences in elevations measured from a reference location known as a benchmark.
This manual presents basic principles and practices of surveying for highway construction and maintenance work. It discusses techniques for measuring horizontal distances and vertical elevations, construction staking and slopes, and gives a number of examples and exercises.
Accuracy is very important in survey work. Some points must be located to the nearest
0.01 foot. Others may be located to the nearest whole foot horizontally and nearest 0.1 foot vertically. Accuracy is also sometimes described in terms of a ratio such as 1/100 (one in one hundred). This means the measurements should be accurate to within one foot in 100 feet, or 10 feet over a distance of 1,000 feet, for example.
Before choosing personnel and selecting survey equipment, it is important to determine the accuracy required for the job. Cut and fill slopes and ditches, for example, don’t require the same accuracy as drain inlets and finished pavement grades.
No survey measurement is ever exact. Surveys are subject to error, so always check your work. It is better to take the time to do it right than having to find the time and money to correct mistakes.
■	Measuring horizontal distances
Horizontal distances may be determined by many methods. The survey tape is the most common, but other methods and devices are also used in highway work.
-	Pacing Count the number of steps and multiply by the known length of each step. This is used to provide distance estimates when no measuring device is available or precision is not required. Experienced personnel may achieve a precision of 1/50.
-	Measuring wheel On this commercial device, distance is measured by each rotation of a wheel and reported on a dial. It is commonly used to record distances such as curb length or paving quantities and can also be helpful for determining distances along a curve. Precision is usually 1/500
-	Odometer Vehicle odometers are helpful in determining long distances such as for sign layout or checking vision at intersections. Precision of 1/20 is reasonable.
-	Estimates Skilled people can often estimate distances with good results. This may be sufficient for some purposes.
-	Electronic Modern surveying uses a variety of electronic equipment to measure distances. This quickly provides very precise measurements but requires experienced personnel and relatively expensive equipment.

•	Pacing
Pacing consists of counting the number of steps or paces in a required distance. Distances obtained by pacing are sufficiently accurate for many purposes in surveying. Pacing is also used to validate survey work and eliminate any taping blunders.
Measuring your pace length requires a measured 100-foot distance. You then walk this distance and count the number of steps. It is best to repeat the process four times and average the results.
It is possible to adjust your pace to an even three feet, but this should usually be avoided. It is very difficult to maintain an unnatural pace length over a long distance. Accurate pacing is done by using your natural pace, even if it is an uneven length such as 2.6 feet. It is difficult to maintain an even pace when going up hill or down hill.
Using your natural pace will make this easier.
Another error can occur if you are not consistent in starting with either the heel or toe of your shoe. If you place your toe at the start point, then also measure the end point with your toe. Starting with the heel and ending with the toe is a common mistake.
Some surveyors prefer to count strides. A stride is two steps or paces. This reduces the counting but often requires using part of a stride to determine the total distance.
Pacing is a valuable skill for surveyors. It requires some practice and concentration. Experienced pacers can measure distances within 1/50 to 1/100 in open and level terrain.
•	Tapes
Tapes come in many different materials and styles.
-	Cloth Cloth tapes are common in construction surveys. They are 5/8 inch wide and made of high-grade linen or plastic.
-	Metallic Metallic tapes are often either 50 feet or 100 feet in length and come on enclosed reel cases. Be careful when using metal tapes around electrical sources.
-	Builders tapes Builders tapes are often narrower and lighter than surveyor’s tapes. They are also often shorter and come in enclosed cases. They may be in feet and inches rather than hundredths of feet.
-	Surveyors/engineers tape These tapes are made of steel and are _ inch to 3/4 inch wide in 100, 200, and even 500 feet lengths. The 100-foot tape is common. They may be wound on an open or closed reel. Typically they are graduated at every foot and marked from 0 to 100. Some subtracting tapes have only the last foot at each end divided into tenths and hundredths. Others, called adding tapes, have an extra graduated foot beyond the zero mark.

•	Historical surveyor’s chain
Early surveyors in Wisconsin used the Gunter Chain to measure horizontal distances. This came from England and is named after the inventor, Edmund Gunter. It consisted of an actual chain made of individual links. Early chains were wood; later ones were made of iron.
The early surveyor’s chain used the English length of 66 feet. There were 100 links, each 0.66 feet in length. While 66 feet seems unusual, it was used to keep the early chains from being too long and heavy. Sixty-six feet is proportional to our English mile and acre. There are 80 chain lengths to a mile, 40 chains to a half-mile, etc. One acre is measured as 10 chains long (660 feet) by one chain wide (66 feet), giving 43,560 square feet.
chains, or 660 feet. A rod is 1/4 of a chain or 16.5 feet. Rods are commonly used in early highway right-of way descriptions. The Wisconsin Statutes still describe right-of- way as 3 or 4 rods.

•	Taping methods
It takes some skill to measure distances with a tape and produce accurate, consistent results. The following suggestions help avoid errors and sloppy work:
Reading the tape. The first, often overlooked, step involves a review of the tape. Tapes may have several types of scales and gradations. First determine if the tape uses metric or English units. Then review the gradations. The most common surveying tape will have gradations in feet and hundredths of a foot. Often the even footmarks are in red with tenths marked in black numbers. The 0.05 gradation lines are usually longer than the hundredths (0.01) but shorter than the 0.10 marks.
The end of the tape is another important item to inspect. You must locate the zero point. Some common cloth tapes have a hinged clip to aid in measuring distances by yourself. Often the zero point is at the end of the hinge. The point is to inspect and be sure you know where the zero point is on the tape you are using.
When measuring a long distance of several tape lengths you must take care in lining up the measurements. An error is introduced if you do not measure in a straight line. A straight line is maintained by having the rear tape person direct the forward tape person so that he or she is in line with the finish point (called “lining in”). A range pole or some other device is used to mark the forward point. A considerable error can result if you are not careful to line in the measurements over a long distance.
The tape must also be pulled tight when measuring a distance. Sagging will cause an error. Wind is also a problem that causes additional error. A tension in the range of 10 to 20 pounds is necessary. To maintain a steady pull, it is helpful to have leather thongs on the tape ends. Wrap one hand around the thong, keep the forearms against the body, and face at right angles to the line. Good communication between head and rear tape persons will avoid jerking the tape and will save time.
Measuring over rough ground or areas of brush requires the tape to be held horizontal rather than laid on the ground. The tape is usually held near waist height and plumb- bobs are necessary to mark the end points. The tape is marked by placing the plumb- bob string over the proper tape graduation and securing it with one thumb. Survey pins or stakes may be used to mark points. A mark on the stake top or a tack may be used to mark the points being measured.
Errors from improper lining, sag, wind, or uneven ground result in measurements that are too long; the recorded length is more than the actual distance. On the other hand, these errors cause the length between points being set in the field, to be short. For example, if the tape sag causes an error of 1 foot in a distance of 100 ft, then stakes being set 100 feet apart would only actually be 99 feet apart. If several of these factors are present the error accumulates and can be substantial. Accurate taping requires skill and attention to detail.

•	Horizontal distances
Surveying and highway construction practice use horizontal distances rather than slope distances. This is necessary because the horizontal distance between two points does not change even if the ground is disturbed. If the surveyor used slope distances, then the distance between objects and places would change every time the grade changed.

Figure 3 shows the relationship between horizontal and slope distance. The slope distance is always greater than the horizontal distance. Obviously, the greater the slope, the greater the difference between horizontal and slope distance. If great precision is not required and the slopes are not steep, then you may use the slope distance. Naturally it is easier to lay the tape on the ground than to use plumb-bobs to measure distances. Table 1 shows the effect of using slope distances for various slopes.
Horizontal Distance if Slope is:
Taping on sloping ground often requires use of the “breaking tape” procedure. Where a 100-foot length cannot be held horizontal without plumbing above chest height, you must measure shorter distances. Figure 4 illustrates this procedure.
In the example, the tape’s zero point is held at point A. The steep slope limits the first distance to about 30 feet. Measuring beyond this length required the tape to be held above the chest of the forward tape person. A point is set at 30 feet and the rear tape person moves to the 30-foot mark, with the tape on the ground. The forward tape person moves ahead until the tape is again about waist or chest high when held
horizontal. In this example, the 45-foot mark is placed and the process is repeated for the final segment. The individual measurements must be totaled for the final measurement.
If the total distance is likely to be less than 100 feet, then it is easier to let the tape do the adding. Placing the 30-foot mark on the tape at the ground 30-foot point does this. Then the next point would read on the tape as 75 feet. This eliminates the need to total the individual distances.

Taping downhill is preferable to uphill, because the rear point is held steady on the ground, while the other end is plumbed. In taping uphill the forward point is set while the other end (being plumbed) may be wavering somewhat.
•	Stationing
Stationing is used to establish a reference in highway and building construction. This base line or reference can then be used to locate features along and adjacent to the base line.
Figure 5 shows a typical centerline stationing. It may start at zero or, often, at 10 or 100 to avoid negative stations during future surveys. The stationing or distance increases along the line. By convention, highway stations increase from west to east and south to north.
Stations are 100 feet apart. Points in between are measured from the last station and indicated as plus (+) distances. For example, a point 32.5 feet ahead for station 10 is called 10+32.5
The stationing (baseline) can also be used to locate features adjacent to the baseline. For example a culvert inlet may be described as being at station 26+78, 30 feet Rt. (right). This means the inlet is 30 feet right of station 26+78. The offset is measured at a right angle to the centerline (or baseline). One must face in the direction of increasing stations when determining right or left.
•	Right triangles
Angles of 90 degrees, called right angles, are used commonly in surveying. Right triangles, which have one 90-degree angle, have some unique characteristics that are helpful to know and understand.

Figure 6 illustrates some of these properties. If we know the length of any two sides of a right triangle, then we can calculate the length of the remaining side. This is known as the Pythagorean theorem. To use this property, you must determine the square root of a number, which is very easy with a hand calculator.
It is also helpful to know the features of a special type of right triangle. If the sides are multiples of the 3:4:5 triangle, then the calculations are made easy.
You can use the properties of right triangles to set right angles from a baseline. For example to locate a feature from the centerline, you can establish a 15ft:20ft:25ft triangle as shown in Figure 7.
Another, more approximate method, is sometimes used in the field. You can stand on the centerline and point each hand in opposite directions down the centerline, then close your eyes and swing your hands together in front of you. Your hands will then be pointing approximately at right angles from the centerline.
 
Vertical distances are measured from a point of known elevation called a benchmark. On local surveys the benchmark is usually set at an arbitrary elevation such as 100.0. On surveys for large projects the benchmark will likely be a federal, state or county benchmark. The US Coast Survey and Geodetic Survey have established a system of permanent benchmarks throughout the United States. These are made of concrete or steel with a brass disk on the top. The location and elevation are stamped on the disk.
Elevations on federal or state benchmarks will be related to average sea level. The marked elevation is the vertical distance from average sea level to the top of the benchmark. For example elevations in Madison, Wisconsin, are about 850.0 feet.
In setting local project benchmarks it is highly recommended that you make the arbitrary elevation large enough so that there is no need to use negative numbers in any part of the project. Negative elevations can be used, but they only complicate the math. An arbitrary benchmark elevation of 100.0 is common and works well as long as no part of the project is more than 100 feet below the benchmark.
Level rods are used to measure vertical distances. They are available in English or metric units. The English unit rods may divide feet into either hundredths or inches. Highway projects may use either English or metric level rods have several features to make reading easier. The footmarks are in large red numbers and may be repeated in several places as a small red number. This helps because the level sight is often small and shows only several tenths of the rod at a time.
Level rods in hundredths use alternating white and black bars for each one-hundredth (0.01). Every five one-hundredths (0.05) has a bar with a chisel point end. Therefore, every even tenth point and intermittent five-one-hundredth point also has a chisel point.
It is essential that the level rod be held in a “true” vertical position, since it is measuring a vertical distance. If the rod is leaning, then the reading is not actually the true vertical distance. Leaning the rod forward, backward, or to the side will cause an error. Keeping the rod “plumb” is the rod person’s job because the person reading the measurements cannot readily tell if the rod is leaning.
The hand level is a simple and inexpensive device. It is sufficient for many construction projects where great accuracy or long distances are not involved.
The hand level is normally not magnified. It provides a line of sight with a bubble level attached. The observer sees the target and level bubble at the same time. The rod reading is made using the crosshair when the bubble is centered. Bracing the hand level on a staff or lath will make it much easier to steady and read.

 
•	Leveling procedure
The hand level and rod are used to establish and verify elevations. If you only want to determine the difference between two points, then you can make two direct readings as shown in Figure 10. The difference in rod readings (one subtracted from the other) is the difference in elevation between the points.

If more than two points are involved, then a leveling procedure is used. The procedure involves starting at the benchmark, establishing the height of the instrument, and then taking rod readings on points where new elevations are to be established. Figure 11 illustrates the procedure.
The back sight, an elevation reading to a known benchmark, allows you to calculate the height of the instrument. The term height of instrument means the height of the observer’s eye when using a hand level.

When the level rod is next placed on a new point as shown in Figure 12, we can then calculate the elevation of this point. The elevation is calculated by subtracting the foresight rod reading from the height of instrument. A foresight is the elevation reading of a point of unknown elevation.

The rod could be moved to other points as shown in Figure 13, and similar calculations would determine the elevations of these points.


Most construction projects require covering an area too big to be done from a single instrument setup. The example below shows how to carry the elevations to other locations.
The example in figure 14 starts with a known project benchmark of 100.0 (a spike in a tree). We want to determine the elevation of two other points TP1 and TR2. Surveyors use the term “turning point” (TP) for new points they use when carrying elevations to new location
The surveyor sets up between the benchmark (BM) and TR1. A back sight (6.1) is taken to the BM. This lets you calculate the height of instrument (HI) as 106.1. The surveyor then turns and takes a foresight reading on TR1 of 5.5. This permits calculating the elevation of TP1 as 100.6.
The surveyor then moves forward to a location between TP1 and TP2. A backsight reading on TP1 is 9.7. This allows a calculation of the new HI of 110.6 (100.6 + 9.7= 110.3).
The surveyor then turns and takes a foresight reading on TP2 of 4.8. This allows the calculation of the elevation of TP2 as 105.5 (110.3 – 4.8 = 105.5)
This procedure can be repeated to establish the elevation of other points. It is good practice to complete the level circuit by returning to a known benchmark. This could be another known project benchmark or back to the original benchmark. The surveyor will calculate the elevation of the benchmark just as though it is a new point. Then compare the calculated elevation with the known elevation. Hopefully they will be the same or within the accuracy range for the project. This checking technique will assure that there are no blunders or gross mistakes. If the check elevation varies more than acceptable tolerance for the project, the surveyor should redo the survey work until it checks correctly.
•	Survey notes
It is essential that the surveyor take clear field notes. This reduces mistakes and allows others to use the notes for future surveys. The format shown below is standard surveying technique.
Field notes are arranged in five columns. Column 1 is for a description of the feature being surveyed. For example the benchmark (BM), turning point (TP), culvert invert, ditch bottom, etc.
Column 2 is for the back sight (BS). This is always a reading on a point of known elevation. The column heading has a plus (+) sign. This indicates the surveyor should add this reading to the benchmark elevation in order to calculate the height of instrument (HI).
Column 3 is the height of instrument (HI). It is calculated from the BS reading.
Column 4 is the foresight (FS) reading. This is a rod reading taken on a point of unknown elevation. The column heading has a minus (–) sign. This indicates the reading is to be subtracted from the HI to calculate the elevation of the point.
Column 5 is the elevation of the point. It is calculated from the HI minus the FS.
Figure 10 shows a common placement of figures in the field notes. The HI is often placed a line below the BS. This makes it easier to find the HI. One can also visualize that the HI is located between the BS and the next FS point.
An alternate is shown in Figure 15. This option has the back sight (BS) placed in the line below (next to the HI). Some find this easier because it indicates the BS is taken to calculate the HI and avoids two readings shown for one point.
The leveling procedure will establish elevation at points of interest on project. The existing elevations can then be compared to finished grade elevations on a grading project. The required cut on fill is the calculated for each point of interest.
In the example in Figure 17 the existing elevations are noted. The field notes below can be used to calculate the required cut on fill as shown.
•	One Person Leveling
There is often a need for one person to accomplish field surveying tasks. Examples include placing grade stakes, equipment operators resetting stakes during construction, etc. This requires special techniques, but many tasks can be accomplished alone once the surveyor understands the basics.
One person cannot both hold a level rod on a distant point and take the elevation reading. Therefore the normal technique involves marking a known elevation with a line on a lath. In Figure 19 for example, a line is marked 3 feet above the known point of elevation. We now know this line is 3 feet above the known elevation.
Then the surveyor moves to a new location and rests the hand level along side the level rod and shoots back at the marked lath. The hand level is adjusted until it is level with the marked line on the lath. The height of the hand level on the level rod is then noted. For example the hand level is at the 5-foot mark on the level rod, when it matches the line on the lath. For the example in figure 12 we now can calculate that the bottom of the level rod is 2 feet below the elevation of the point at the lath.

Figure 20 illustrates another example. To determine the difference in elevation between points A and B, the lone surveyor marks the lath 2.0 feet above point A. The reading on the level rod is 4.6 feet when the hand level line of sight is on the marked lath. The difference is calculated as 2.6 feet. Therefore the elevation at point B is (89.0-2.6) 87.3 feet.
Figure 21 shows the staking of the shoulder and ditch grade by using the centerline grade. Assume the existing centerline is at finished grade and the shoulder and ditch grades are to be lower by the amounts in Figure 21. The lone surveyor starts by making a lath at the centerline as 2.5 feet above the centerline. With the level rod reading at the shoulder of 2.3, we know the existing ground at the shoulder is 0.2 feet higher than the centerline. Therefore, we need to mark the grade stake with a cut of 0.5 feet (0.2 +0.3). In the same manner the cut marked at the ditch is (2.0-0.5) 1.5 feet.
•	Adjustment of hand level
Levels may go out of alignment. Use the following procedure to check and adjust if necessary. Two people are required for this procedure.
Start with a pole or post, called pole 1 in Figure 22. Mark a point A and take a level reading with the level held on point A. Mark the level reading at point B on pole 2. Then move the level to pole 2. Hold the level on point B and shoot back at pole 1. If the level is in alignment, then the reading will be on point A and no adjustment is needed. If however the sight is not through point A, then mark the point as C. Adjust the level so that the sight from point 2 goes through a point half way between points A and C. This new point D is level with point B.
•	Common leveling mistakes
Common mistakes made while leveling are summarized below along with steps to avoid mistakes.
-	Reading the wrong footmark Always read up from the footmark below. If the footmark below is not visible, have the rod person raise the rod slowly.
-	Rod section skipped  Pull all out sections of the extendable rod fully before starting.
-	Rod not vertical Stand directly behind the rod. Hold the rod with two hands, lightly grip and balance the rod with both hands.
-	Rod held on wrong point Communicate clearly to rod person exactly where to place rod.
-	Other tips·
·	Try to set up so as to read at least one foot above surfaces that are warm to avoid heat waves.
·	Set up to keep sights as short as possible.
·	Set up to keep back sights and foresights nearly equal in length.
·	Use solid benchmarks that can be easily found by others. Examples include: top nut on a fire hydrant, sewer inlet, top of curb with a chisel mark, spike in tree or pole, etc.
■	Construction staking
Stakes and lath are used to mark location and elevations (grades) in the field. They are a very important communication tool between the designer, the surveyor and the contractor. Practices in marking stakes will vary between agencies. Therefore, the surveyor must determine what practice is preferred and understood by others involved in the project. The information below is common on many projects.

-	Station The stake is located along the reference or centerline. Stationing is commonly used.
1+00
7+25.45
-	Offset distance The stake is located either right or left of the centerline. It is common to offset construction stakes because the construction will likely have to disturb the ground. Therefore, the stake is located several feet away in order to avoid being disturbed during construction. One must be facing up-station (in the direction of increasing stationing) to properly determine right or left.
10 feet right (RT) 25 feet left (LT)
-	Grade elevation Set the amount of cut or fill between the stake and the finished elevation. Some agencies prefer to mark a line on the stake and indicate the amount of cut (or fill) from the marked line. This has the advantage of giving the option to use even feet for the cut (or fill). Other agencies prefer to indicate the cut (or fill) from the ground elevation at the stake. This may be somewhat simpler to determine for the surveyor, but usually involves a cut (or fill) in uneven numbers (“cut 2.7 feet,” for example). A third option is to use the top of the stake rather than the ground. For example stakes for grading the subgrade or finished base may be placed with the top of stake at desired finished grade. These are often called red tops, for subgrade elevations or blue tops for base elevations because the stake tops are colored for increased visibility.
Another option is to mark the finished grade on the stake. This only works if the finished grade elevation falls within the height of the stake.
C 3.0 Indicates a cut of 3.0 feet from mark or ground F 2.5 Indicates a fill of 2.5 feet from mark or ground V Indicates finished grade at mark or ground.
•	Calculating cut and fill
Determining the amount of cut (or fill) to mark on the stake is often confusing to beginning surveyors. Figure 25 may help in visualizing the process.

Normally the surveyor knows the finished elevation of the object (culvert, sewer, ditch, etc.). If you determine the elevation of the existing ground, then the problem is to calculate the cut or fill. If the stake indicates cut from the ground, then the difference in elevations (ground elevation minus the finished elevation) is the cut. If the stake is to be marked with a cut or fill line, then an additional calculation is required.
First, determine the cut or fill from the ground. Next, measure up the stake from the ground an amount to make the cut or fill an even distance. For example, if the cut from the ground is 2.4 feet, then measure up 0.6 feet from the ground. This is the point where you could mark cut 3.0 feet. Sometimes you may want to mark all stakes with the same cut amount. In the previous example let assume you want to mark all stakes with a cut of 4.0 feet. Then the cut line would be marked 1.6 feet above the ground.
■	Slopes and grades
Designers are very concerned with establishing proper slopes and grades for their projects. Surveyors must be familiar with the various methods used to describe and calculate slopes and grades. There are several methods commonly used to determine slopes and set grades.

•	Percent
Road centerline profile, culvert, sewer, and ditch grades are normally described in terms of percent. Figure 26 illustrates how the calculations are made.
The road steepness is measured by percent slope. This is calculated, as shown, by dividing the “rise” by the “run.” This amount is in decimal form. Convert it to a percent by multiplying the decimal by 100.

•	Ratios
Roadway side-slopes and back-slopes are usually describes in terms of a ratio such as 2 to 1, for example. The ratio is understood to mean a proportional horizontal distance and the associated change in vertical distance. For example 2 to 1 would refer to a slope with a vertical drop of 1 foot for every horizontal distance of 2 feet. Often the ratio is written as 2:1. Figure 27 shows example slopes of 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1.
Older highway plans may use the inches per foot method to describe crown. Plans for buildings may also use this method. It is similar to the ratio method except the vertical dimension is expressed in inches and the horizontal dimension is one foot.

The crown may be described as 1/4 inch per foot, for example. This means the crown is elevated 1/4 inch for every foot of pavement width. Thus, a 12-foot lane would have a total crown of 1/4 inch times 12 feet, or 3 inches. A 4 foot shoulder with a cross slope of 1/2 inch per foot would have 1/2 inch times 4 feet, or 2 inches, of crown.
■	Field exercises, examples and solutions
•	Field exercises

AM Exercise - Pacing

The new ditch grade is 1% sloping down toward station 2+00. Set at least the first three new ditch grade stakes. If time allows, set 10’ offset stakes.

PM Exercise 4 - Ditch location
A new ditch is to be constructed, with the bottom of the ditch 3.0 feet below the existing centerline. The new road will have a 12-foot lane with a crown of 1/4 inch per foot. The new shoulder is 6 feet in width and has a crown of 1/2 inch per foot. The side slope is 6:1.

1.	Introduction
Light detection and ranging (lidar) mapping is an accepted method of generating precise and directly georeferenced spatial information about the shape and surface characteristics of the Earth. Recent advancements in lidar mapping systems and their enabling technologies allow scientists and mapping professionals to examine natural and built environments across a wide range of scales with greater accuracy, precision, and flexibility than ever before. Several national reports issued over the past five years highlight the value and critical need of lidar data. The National Enhanced Elevation Assessment (NEEA) surveyed over 200 federal, state, local, tribal, and nongovernmental organizations to better understand how they use enhanced elevation data, such as lidar data. The over 400 resulting functional activities were grouped into 27 predefined business uses for summary and benefit-cost analysis (NDEP, 2012). Several of these activities will be described in more detail in the applications section of this document.
There are many considerations and trade-offs that must be understood in order to make sound decisions about the procurement, processing, and application of lidar data. This document provides introductory and overview information, as well as in-depth technical information, to support decision-making in all phases of lidar projects. While the information presented here is not comprehensive, it covers aspects of the technology that are the most common subjects of discussion within the coastal management community.
2.	What Is Lidar?
Overview
Lidar has become an established method for collecting very dense and accurate elevation data across landscapes, shallow-water areas, and project sites. This active remote sensing technique is similar to radar but uses laser light pulses instead of radio waves. Lidar is typically “flown” or collected from planes where it can rapidly collect points over large areas (Figure 2-1). Lidar is also collected from ground-based stationary and mobile platforms. These collection techniques are popular within the surveying and engineering communities because they are capable of producing extremely high accuracies and point densities, thus permitting the development of precise, realistic, three-dimensional representations of railroads, roadways, bridges, buildings, breakwaters, and other shoreline structures.
Collection of elevation data using lidar has several advantages over most other techniques. Chief among them are higher resolutions, centimeter accuracies, and ground detection in forested terrain. This section will address 1) the basics of lidar, 2) the terminology, and 3) some examples of how the data are routinely used.
What Is Lidar?
Lidar, which is commonly spelled LiDAR and also known as LADAR or laser altimetry, is an acronym for light detection and ranging. It refers to a remote sensing technology that emits intense, focused beams of light and measures the time it takes for the reflections to be detected by the sensor. This information is used to compute ranges, or distances, to objects. In this manner, lidar is analogous to radar (radio detecting and ranging), except that it is based on discrete pulses of laser light. The three-dimensional coordinates (e.g., x,y,z or latitude, longitude, and elevation) of the target objects are computed from 1) the time difference between the laser pulse being emitted and returned, 2) the angle at which the pulse was “fired,” and 3) the absolute location of the sensor on or above the surface of the Earth.
There are two classes of remote sensing technologies that are differentiated by the source of energy used to detect a target: passive systems and active systems. Passive systems detect radiation that is generated by an external source of energy, such as the sun, while active systems generate and direct energy toward a target and subsequently detect the radiation. Lidar systems are active systems because they emit pulses of light (i.e. the laser beams) and detect the reflected light. This characteristic allows lidar data to be collected at night when the air is usually clearer and the sky contains less air traffic than in the daytime. In fact, most lidar data are collected at night. Unlike radar, lidar cannot penetrate clouds, rain, or dense haze and must be flown during fair weather.
Lidar instruments can rapidly measure the Earth’s surface, at sampling rates greater than 150 kilohertz (i.e., 150,000 pulses per second). The resulting product is a densely spaced network of highly accurate georeferenced elevation points (Figure 2-2)—often called a point cloud—that can be used to generate three-dimensional representations of the Earth’s surface and its features. Many lidar systems operate in the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, although some sensors also operate in the green band to penetrate water and detect bottom features. These bathymetric lidar systems can be used in areas with relatively clear water to measure seafloor elevations. Typically, lidar-derived elevations have absolute accuracies of about 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) for older data and 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters) for more recent data; relative accuracies (e.g., heights of roofs, hills, banks, and dunes) are even better. The description of accuracy is an important aspect of lidar and will be covered in detail in the following sections.


The ability to “see under trees” is a recurring goal when acquiring elevation data using remote sensing data collected from above the Earth’s surface (e.g., airplanes or satellites). Most of the larger scale elevation data sets have been generated using remote sensing technologies that cannot penetrate vegetation. Lidar is no exception; however, there are typically enough individual “points” that, even if only a small percentage of them reach the ground through the trees, there are usually enough to provide adequate coverage in forested areas. In effect, lidar is able to see through holes in the canopy or vegetation. Dense forests or areas with complete coverage (as in a rain forest), however, often have few “openings” and so have poor ground representation (i.e., all the points fall on trees and mid-canopy vegetation). A rule of thumb is that if you can look up and see the sky through the trees, then that location can be measured with lidar. For this reason, collecting lidar in “leaf off” conditions is advantageous for measuring ground features in heavily forested areas.
Lidar Platforms
Airborne topographic lidar systems are the most common lidar systems used for generating digital elevation models for large areas. The combination of an airborne platform and a scanning lidar sensor is an effective and efficient technique for collecting elevation data across tens to thousands of square miles. For smaller areas, or where higher density is needed, lidar
 
sensors can also be deployed on helicopters and ground-based (or water-based) stationary and mobile platforms.
Lidar was first developed as a fixed-position ground-based instrument for studies of atmospheric composition, structure, clouds, and aerosols and remains a powerful tool for climate observations around the world. NOAA and other research organizations operate these instruments to enhance our understanding of climate change. Lidar sensors are also mounted on fixed-position tripods and are used to scan specific targets such as bridges, buildings, and beaches. Tripod-based lidar systems produce point data with centimeter accuracy and are often used for localized terrain-mapping applications that require frequent surveys.
Modern navigation and positioning systems enable the use of water-based and land-based mobile platforms to collect lidar data. These systems are commonly mounted on sport-utility and all-terrain vehicles and may have sensor-to-target ranges greater than a kilometer. Data collected from these platforms are highly accurate and are used extensively to map discrete areas, including railroads, roadways, airports, buildings, utility corridors, harbors, and shorelines.

Airplanes and helicopters are the most common and cost-effective platforms for acquiring lidar data over broad, continuous areas. Airborne lidar data are obtained by mounting a system inside an aircraft and flying over targeted areas. Most airborne platforms can cover about 50 square kilometers per hour and still produce data that meet or exceed the requirements of applications that demand high-accuracy data. Airborne platforms are also ideal for collecting bathymetric data in relatively clear, shallow water. Combined topographic and bathymetric lidar systems on airborne platforms are used to map shoreline and nearshore areas.
Basic Terminology
A discussion of lidar often includes technical terms that describe the level of accuracy (a very important aspect of lidar data), data collection, and the ensuing processing steps.
•	LAS – abbreviation for laser file format; the LAS file format is a public file format for the interchange of 3-dimensional point cloud data between data users. Although developed primarily for the exchange of lidar point cloud data, this format supports the exchange
 
of any 3-dimensional x,y,z tuplet. LAS is a binary file format that maintains information specific to the lidar nature of the data while not being overly complex.
•	RMSE – abbreviation for root mean square error; a measure of the accuracy of the data similar to the measure of standard deviation if there is no bias in the data.
•	Accuracyz, Fundamental Vertical Accuracy (FVA) – a measure of the accuracy of the data in open areas at a high level of confidence (95%); calculated from the RMSE using the formula RMSE x 1.96 = FVA.
•	Classification – data that have been processed to define the type of object that the pulses have reflected off; can be as simple as unclassified (i.e., object not defined) to buildings and high vegetation. The most common is to classify the data set for points that are considered “bare earth” and those that are not (unclassified).
•	Return Number (First/Last Returns) – many lidar systems are capable of capturing the first, second, third, and ultimately the “last” return from a single laser pulse. The return number can be used to help determine what the reflected pulse is from (e.g., ground, tree, understory).
•	Point Spacing – how close the laser points are to each other, analogous to the pixel size of an aerial image; also called “posting density” or “nominal point spacing.” The point spacing determines the resolution of derived gridded products.
•	Pulse Rate – the number of discrete laser “shots” per second that the lidar instrument is firing. Systems used in 2012 were capable of up to 300,000 pulses per second. More commonly, the data are captured at approximately 50,000 to 150,000 pulses per second.
•	Intensity Data – when the laser return is recorded, the strength of the return is also recorded. The values represent how well the object reflected the wavelength of light used by the laser system (e.g., 1,064 nanometer for most commercial topography sensors in the U.S.). These data resemble a black and white photo but cannot be interpreted in exactly the same manner.
•	RTK GPS (Real Time Kinematic GPS) – satellite navigation that uses the carrier phase (a waveform) that transmits (carries) the Global Positioning System (GPS) signal instead of the GPS signal itself. The actual GPS signal has a frequency of about 1 megahertz, whereas the carrier wave has a frequency of 1500 megahertz, so a difference in signal arrival time is more precise. The carrier phase is more difficult to use (i.e., the equipment is more costly); however, once it has been resolved, it produces a more accurate position in relation to the higher frequency.
•	DEM, or Digital Elevation Model – a surface created from elevation point data to represent the topography. Often a DEM is more easily used in a geographic information system (GIS) or computer-aided design (CAD) application than the raw point data it is constructed from.
 
Basic Principles and Techniques
The basic idea (Figure 2-4) is fairly straightforward: measure the time that it takes a laser pulse to strike an object and return to the sensor (which itself has a known location due to direct georeferencing systems), determine the distance using the travel time, record the laser angle, and then, from this information, compute where the reflecting object (e.g., ground, tree, car, etc.) is located in three dimensions.
In reality, to achieve a high level of accuracy, this process is a bit more complicated since it is important to know, within a centimeter or so, where the plane is as it flies at 100 to 200 miles per hour, bumping up and down, while keeping track of hundreds of thousands of lidar pulses per second. Fortunately, several technologies—especially the Global Positioning System (GPS) and precision gyroscopes—came together to make it possible.
Major advancements in Inertial Measuring Units (IMU) or Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) have been instrumental in making the exact positioning of the plane possible. These systems are capable of measuring movement in all directions and parlaying these measurements into a position. They are, however, not perfect, and lose precision after a short time (e.g., 1 second). A very highly sophisticated GPS unit, which records several types of signals from the GPS satellites, is used to “update or reset” the INS or IMU every second or so. The GPS positions are recorded by the plane and also at a ground station with a known position. The ground station provides a “correction” factor to the GPS position recorded by the plane.
Likewise, lidar systems have advanced considerably. Early commercial units were capable of 10,000 points per second (10 kilohertz) and were large and bulky. Newer systems are more compact, lighter, have higher angular precision, and can process multiple laser returns in the air (i.e., a second laser shot is emitted before returns from the previous laser shot are received), allowing for pulse rates of over 300,000 per second (300 kilohertz).
Multiple return systems, which are common, can capture up to five returns per pulse (Figure 2- 5). This can increase the amount of data by 30% or more (100,000 pulses/second ≈ 130,000 returns/second) and increases the ability to look at the three-dimensional structure of the “features above the ground surface,” such as the forest canopy and understory.

Lidar, as a remote sensing technique, has several advantages. Chief among them are high accuracies, high point density, large coverage areas, and the ability of users to resample areas quickly and efficiently. This creates the ability to map discrete changes at a very high resolution, cover large areas uniformly and very accurately, and produce rapid results. The applications below are examples of some common uses of lidar.

•	Updating and Creating Flood Insurance Rate Maps (Figure 2-6) – This application is a major driver in the development and use of lidar data. The application was largely brought about when hurricanes hit North Carolina and the existing mapped flood zones were quickly shown to be inadequate.

•	Forest and Tree Studies – A very costly and time-consuming aspect of timber management is the effort spent in the field measuring trees (Figure 2-7). Typically a sample of trees is measured for a number of parameters and the results are statistically extrapolated throughout the harvest area. Trees must be measured to determine how much wood is present, when it is most appropriate to harvest, and how much to
harvest. High-resolution, small-footprint lidar has been used to count trees and measure tree height, crown width, and crown depth. From these measurements, the standing volume of timber can be estimated on an individual tree basis, or on a stand level with larger footprint lidar.

•	Coastal Change Mapping – Mapping the coastal zone is an application that highlights the use of lidar data (Figure 2-8) along with GIS layers to increase the utility of both data sets. This highly dynamic region changes on very short timescales (e.g., waves, tides, storms), contains many natural habitats that are highly dependent on elevation, and is densely populated. As a result, the rapid changes can affect significant populations and habitats, both of which are becoming less tolerant to change (i.e., there is less ability to retreat). Lidar data provide the ability to measure specific events as well as longer-term trends. This provides information that can be applied to immediate restoration solutions for critical areas, as well as sustainable planning to minimize future impacts.
History
Lidar technology is not new; it was developed over 40 years ago and was initially used for mapping particles in the atmosphere. In this ground-based application, there was far less positional complexity (i.e., the position of the laser did not move) than in airborne mapping. During the 1980s, the development of GPS opened up the applications to moving sensors (airborne lidar). Bathymetric lidar was actually one of the first uses of airborne lidar. The surface of the water provided a “reference” that de-emphasized the absolute location of the airplane. The early 1990s saw the improvement of the IMU and the ability to begin achieving decimeter accuracies. Some of the earlier non-bathymetric airborne applications were in the measurement of glaciers and how they were changing. Ground-based lidar (terrestrial scanning) is also beginning to be used as a way to densely map the three-dimensional nature of features and ground surfaces to an extremely high level of accuracy (1 centimeter).
Summary
Lidar, which can also be referred to as LiDAR, LADAR, airborne laser altimetry, or airborne laser swath mapping, is a widespread and common data layer for a wide variety of applications.
Topographic lidar data are typically gathered from airplanes and have benefited from recent advancements in GPS and IMU technology. The technique can provide a dense suite of highly accurate elevation measurements over a large area. While lidar cannot penetrate through
 
trees, the point coverage is dense enough to allow for ample ground measurement through small holes in the canopy in most forested environments. Many of the traditional elevation applications benefit from this increased accuracy and coverage, and new applications are being made possible because of the rich data density and high quality.
3.	Data Produced by Lidar Sensors
Overview
This section will review some of the aspects that make lidar an attractive data source for coastal mapping and natural resource management applications. The data products from lidar technology can be delivered in several formats. This section looks at the various formats and their differences and the ways in which the data are verified and quantified. In essence, this section will provide an overview of lidar data and the GIS products that are derived directly from it.
Improvements over Previous Data
Lidar data represent several important improvements over previous and commonly used vertical data sets generated for U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic quad maps. The data available through the National Elevation Dataset (NED) have largely been created using photogrammetric techniques. The resulting accuracy of the NED is on the order of 3 meters or 10 feet (Gesch, 2007) with 10- to 30-meter resolution. Photogrammetric elevation generation is a time-consuming, labor-intensive process, especially for high-accuracy products, and therefore is a data set that is not updated often. Moreover, the ability to map areas hidden by or below trees is limited because the technique inherently requires that a location be visible from two vantage points (i.e., two images). The result is that much of the NED are fairly old, have vertical accuracies that limit coastal applications, and have horizontal resolutions that preclude the definition of coastal features. Lidar, while similar in cost to photogrammetry, is a more rapid technique that relies largely on new technology to produce results. Note that the NED is being updated with lidar data as they become available, particularly for the newer 1/9th arc-second (about 3 meters) resolution NED, but as of 2011 only 28% of the U.S. excluding Alaska had lidar coverage.
Vertical Accuracy
The vertical accuracy of lidar data is much better than that of older elevation data that did not include lidar sources. For example, Gesch (2007) reviewed a recent version of the National Elevation Dataset using high-accuracy control points and found that the vertical RMSE was approximately 2.4 meters (8 feet). This is a marked improvement over the NED from 1999 that had an RMSE of 3.7 meters and did not include high-accuracy lidar data. Interestingly, even the older lidar data sets typically have RMSE values of less than 20 centimeters (8 inches) and retain great value due to this level of accuracy. The NED is currently incorporating lidar elevation data sets and will have improved performance and utility in time. The topic of different accuracy measures, including RMSE, is considered in greater detail in Section 5 (“Data Customization and Specification: Accuracy Specification and Tests”).
Lidar-derived elevation values in areas with tree coverage are much more dependable than those produced by other techniques because of the sheer number of lidar points. This ability to measure elevations in most obscured areas (Figure 3-1) is one reason the accuracy of lidar is much better (10x) than previously collected data. However, it is important to note that photogrammetric digital elevation model (DEM) data do provide a higher level of confidence
that the points are, indeed, measuring the ground surface. Lidar ground points are determined using automated filters, so while there are significantly more points, they can sometimes fall on non-ground objects or features. For example, there are some ground points (purple in Figure 3- 1) in the middle of the lidar profile that appear suspect and would decrease the accuracy of a bare-earth DEM in that area. The vegetation in that area (yellow points) is dense enough that photogrammetry would not have been able to see the ground.

Horizontal Resolution
The horizontal resolution of point spacing of a data set is an important aspect to consider and can impact the tested vertical accuracy. For example, Figures 3-2 and 3-3 depict how high- frequency variability in the ground surface (e.g., slope changes, depressions, gullies, mounds) can be obscured in low-resolution data sets (i.e., large pixels or widely spaced points). In these situations, the vertical accuracy of elevations at the location of the points may be good, while the accuracy of the interpolated surface between points may be poor if significant features are present but not resolved. Thus, the size of features to be measured is a consideration, and since many features that affect drainage patterns are less than 10 meters, which is the resolution of most of the NED data, the ability to discern their actual course, location, and elevation can be difficult. Recent lidar data (i.e., captured within the past five years) usually have a point spacing (horizontal resolution) of between 1 and 2 meters or better. Higher density lidar (multiple points per square meter) can have upwards of eight points per meter and, thus, has a horizontal resolution of 30 centimeters or less. It should be noted that the actual size of the lidar “spot” on the ground or feature is about 30 to 50 centimeters (1 to 1.5 feet) which means that adjacent points actually overlap. This “oversampling” technique is often used to increase the number of points that penetrate vegetation to reach the ground, thus yielding a more accurate representation of the ground surface while also better characterizing the vertical structure of the vegetated overstory.

	
Temporal Resolution
The time between measurements and the recentness of the data can be as important as data accuracy, especially in the coastal zone, where change, both human and natural, can be dramatic and rapid (Figure 3-4). The highly automated aspect of lidar collection lends itself to rapid deployment and data capture. Temporal resolution is also important for tide-controlled lidar collections. The ability to fly during all hours of the day makes mission planning significantly easier than for photogrammetric techniques.

Accuracy
Accuracy is one of the primary reasons for use of lidar data. Lidar is an accurate, cost-effective method for collecting topographic elevation data for large areas (Fowler and others, 2007). As a result, determining the required level of data accuracy and documenting the achieved level is an important part of data collection and its subsequent use. Typically a data set is collected with a target accuracy value. The vendor can vary flight and instrument parameters to achieve the required accuracy and cost specifications. Once the data have been collected and processed, they are tested to make sure that the collection and subsequent operations were successful in meeting the desired specifications. Documenting data accuracy is important to ensure proper and widespread use and to maximize data utility. Data accuracy is commonly provided in quality assessment documents and in the metadata.
Accuracy Assessment Techniques
The basic goal of an accuracy assessment is to measure known points on the ground (ground control points, or GCPs) and compare those with points generated from the lidar data. This is often carried out separately for points that fall into different ground cover types. For example, bare-earth lidar errors for points that are in open areas will likely be lower than points under trees. The most common land cover types are bare earth, forest, shrub, urban, and weeds or crops. Bare-earth points are used to judge the overall quality of data collection, because these points typically require very little classification processing. The other land cover types are used to test how well the classification process was able to separate points striking non-ground surfaces from those striking the ground.
In practice, independent measurements (points collected in the field) are compared with a surface created from the lidar points. A surface is used because the lidar points, in most cases, will not fall exactly on the spot where the field measurements were collected. The test surface generated from lidar points is typically created using the triangulated irregular network (TIN) method, which has the least amount of “smoothing.” As a result, the lidar elevation is actually a best representation using the three nearest points (i.e., the three points on the triangle). For this reason, it is important that the area being tested not be sloped or irregular; a sloped or irregular surface could potentially bias the elevations. Similarly, the points should be collected in areas where there is a reasonable chance that the lidar can penetrate to the ground (e.g., points should not be collected at the bases of trees where lidar points have little chance of reaching the ground and where the TIN triangles will be large).
Once the values have been compared and the error values generated, several statistical formulas and descriptive terms are used to provide an overview of the data quality. The descriptive terms and their formulas have been developed by several groups and have evolved as the data have become better understood and tested.
Descriptive Terms
The most common terms used to describe a lidar data set’s accuracy were described in the “Basic Terminology” section. Four primary documents have helped define the process of measuring, reporting, and defining the accuracy of lidar elevation data. Guidelines for Digital Elevation Data (NDEP, 2004), “ASPRS Guidelines: Vertical Accuracy Reporting for Lidar Data” (ASPRS, 2004), and “National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy” (FGDC, 1998) provide guidance and formulas for determining elevation data accuracy. “Procedure Memorandum No. 61 – Standards for Lidar and Other High Quality Digital Topography” by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA, 2010) draws on these other data-standard documents and includes specifications for data that are needed for specific flood-mapping applications. The following terms have been developed to provide an overview of the data set as a whole and are often used when defining the quality of data expected for a statement of work. The specific formulas that are used to generate the values for each term are not covered here but can be found in the reference material listed above.
•	The root mean square error (RMSE) is a statistical measure of variability that is very similar to the standard deviation; in a non-biased data set (i.e., the error is normally
distributed above and below zero) the two values will be the same. This measure is commonly used to describe the variability in lidar elevations. For lidar, the value is calculated directly from the difference between the ground control points and the lidar elevation and for lidar is typically between 5 and 30 centimeters.
•	The Fundamental vertical accuracy (FVA) is the accuracy value for bare-earth points at a certain confidence level. In this case it is the 95% confidence level and could be phrased as “95% of the bare-earth points meet or exceed the specified accuracy level.” This statistic provides information on the quality of the data collection parameters (global quality) because it describes only the bare-earth points, which have not been processed for classification. It can be calculated using RMSE x 1.96 if the errors have a normal distribution, which most bare-earth points follow.
•	Supplemental vertical accuracy (SVA) is similar to the FVA (95% accuracy), but it is a measure of the individual ground cover types, of which the bare earth is one. The value is typically calculated at the 95th percentile where errors do not follow a normal distribution, where 95% of elevation values have elevation errors equal to or less than the 95th percentile. For example, if 20 points are collected, the worst point (5%) can be removed and the 19th point provided as the SVA value. The SVA value is reported separately for each land cover type tested and, thus, provides more in-depth information than the consolidated vertical accuracy.
•	Consolidated vertical accuracy (CVA) is also a measure of the accuracy at the 95% level. It is a measure of the entire data set; all the points collected in the various ground types are used together.
Data Types
Like most elevation data, lidar can be stored in a wide variety of formats. The native data are delivered as points (point clouds) that can be processed to create DEMs or TINs (surfaces); the surfaces can then be used to produce contours (lines).
Points
Point data are commonly stored in LAS format, which “is a binary file format that maintains information specific to the LIDAR nature of the data while not being overly complex” (ASPRS, 2007). Lidar data can contain significantly more information than x, y, and z values (Figure 3-5) and may include, among others, the intensity of the returns, the point classification (if done), the number of returns, the time, and the source (flight line) of each point. This information can also come as text files; however, the size of these files can be quite large (several million records with many text characters), making them difficult to work with.
Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)
DEM data are commonly in raster files (Figure 3-6) with formats that include GeoTiff (.tif), Esri Grid (.adf), floating point raster (.flt), or ERDAS Imagine (.img). In some cases the data are available in a TIN format (e.g., Esri TIN). In the raster cases, they are created using point files and can be interpolated using many different techniques.
The techniques used to create DEMs range from simple (e.g., nearest neighbor) to complex (e.g., kriging) gridding routines and can create slightly different surface types (Figure 3-7). The most common are surfaces created from the TIN or the inverse distance weighted (IDW) routines. The appropriate interpolation method depends on the data and the desired use of the DEM.


Hillshade
Hillshading is a technique that helps bring out small variations in elevation data. It is meant to mimic what the ground would look like if the sun were shining on it from a specified angle. This effect can be produced by many of the programs normally used to work with elevation data.
The hillshaded image in Figure 3-8 highlights the texture in the TIN surface (Figure 3-7C) and reveals imperfections in the road surface (bumps and ridges) that were not previously evident. This technique is useful during quality assurance reviews and visualization of lidar data.

Drape
Draping graphics over elevation often provides additional information and added viewing effect (Figure 3-9). This is simply stretching a “picture” over the “bumpy” elevation surface and using hillshade effects. While a simple technique, it does provide additional visualization clues for feature extraction (e.g., dunes, wetlands).

Contours
Contours are commonly available in vector formats (e.g., .shp, .dxf) and are most frequently derived from a pre-constructed DEM or TIN. Contours are among the most commonly used representations for elevations and are found on USGS quad maps. Contours derived directly from lidar data (Figure 3-10A) are accurate but not “clean” and often require a level of interpolation, simplification, smoothing, or manual editing to generate a product that can be more easily interpreted by the human eye (Figure 3-10B). In the process of cleaning and editing the vectors, the position of contours can shift slightly and some small features may even be eliminated. This trade-off between accuracy and interpretability is typically acceptable as lidar- derived contours are most commonly used for cartographic purposes while the original lidar DEMs or TINs are used for analytical purposes.
Highly accurate manually generated breaklines (i.e., vectors delineating slope breaks) are required to achieve pleasing contours with the accuracy of the base lidar data; this is often a very expensive operation. Photogrammetric techniques are commonly used to create three- dimensional breaklines along specific linear features. More recently, a technique known as “lidargrammetry” is being employed. Lidargrammetry uses the intensity values from the lidar points as the “photo” which is processed, using point elevations, into a three-dimensional image. The three-dimensional image can then be used to define breaklines. As a result, separate imagery does not have to be flown for the area where breaklines are required; however, the resulting lidargrammetry breaklines generally do not have as high a resolution as the photogrammetrically derived ones.

Although contours can be less accurate than the data they are created from, their generation and specification largely drives the definition of lidar data accuracy. This is a direct result of their widespread use for engineering and other common depictions. In many projects lidar data
are collected to “support the generation of 2 ft contours” or similar statements, which is a way of specifying the vertical accuracy of the data, but not the horizontal resolution. As a rule of thumb, the contour interval that can be supported is about 3.0 x RMSE for American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) Class 1 contours or 3.5 x RMSE for National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA). Both of these standards are based on the conversion from traditional survey methods, which dictated that data used to create contours had to be at least twice as accurate as the contours they defined. So, traditionally, data that were accurate to 1 foot (at the 90% confidence level) could be used to create 2-foot contours; the ASPRS and NSSDA values simply correspond to the 93 and 95% confidence levels respectively. Other ASPRS contour classes exist (e.g., Class 2 and Class 3) and are less stringent than Class 1. Regardless of standard, the widespread use and generation of contours continues to play a large role in the accuracy specifications for lidar data collections.
Summary
Data produced from lidar include the “raw” point data as well as processed derivatives such as contours and surfaces (DEMs). Point data include not only the elevation values, but also classification values, intensity values, and several other point attributes. DEMs are created from the points and can represent bare earth, if the points have been classified, or other surfaces such as the first surface or the last-return surface. DEMs are also used to create contours, which are a commonly used derivative. In short, lidar data are a lot more than simple x,y,z points, and future derivatives, such as “lidargrammetry” and fusion between lidar and imagery (i.e., point values that also include hyperspectral or natural color imagery values), are being developed to take advantage of the high accuracy and increasingly higher data density coverage of the technology.
4.	Use of Lidar Data
Overview
This section will cover the basic use of lidar data in a typical geographic information system (GIS). Normally, the first step is finding the data online or accessing data from a vendor. The next is specifying data parameters, formats, and what types of data derivatives (e.g., intensity, classification) are desired. Once the data have been specified and received, the loading process will vary depending on the format. The process may require some additional software, steps, or plug-ins along the way depending on the data and software. As with all geospatial data, checking the metadata before use is an important consideration; this section will review some important fields for lidar data. The section should provide most users with enough information to begin using the data on their own.
Obtaining Lidar
Existing lidar data are available from numerous public and private entities, and can be obtained freely or at a cost. In either case, it is important to select data that will support the intended use. There are many specifications to consider (e.g., format, projection, datum, classifications) when obtaining lidar data, and the degree of flexibility offered by different sources varies considerably. See Chapter 5 for a full discussion of data specifications.
Many local, state, and federal agencies provide free lidar data online. Two types of lidar products are generally available through these sites: DEMs (raster) and points. Lidar can also be purchased from a contractor. Existing data (that are not in the public domain) is often less expensive than contracting for a new acquisition, but the client has less control over certain specifications such as point spacing and accuracy. If data are to be acquired by a contractor, many of the data specifications will be handled in the statement of work (SOW). The SOW should define, wherever possible, the formats, projections, datums, post-processing (classification) requirements, accuracies, and derived products (e.g., mass points, contours, DEMs) that are desired. Establishing these parameters is a critical step and should be considered carefully.
The data format and other specifications, although important considerations, are often secondary to coverage extent, so simply finding a source of data is the first big step. Web- accessible data discovery tools range in sophistication. For instance, the Puget Sound Lidar Consortium site provides DEM grids through a simple clickable map interface (Figure 4-1). This approach provides easy and fast access to existing grids, but limits the amount of customization available to the end user. More sophisticated data discovery tools frequently use a Web map interface (e.g., Google Maps) or a Web GIS interface (e.g., ArcGIS Server, MapServer). Data can often be selected and downloaded from these sites as well. The USGS Earth Explorer (Figure 4- 2) and NOAA’s Digital Coast Data Access Viewer (Figure 4-4) provide search and discovery functionality with the option to download data as well. The USGS Earth Explorer can be accessed at the following address: http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov. The NOAA Digital Coast Data Access Viewer is discussed in greater detail below and can be accessed through the Digital Coast site at www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast.

	
U.S. Interagency Elevation Inventory
The U.S. Interagency Elevation Inventory displays high-accuracy topographic and bathymetric data for the United States and its territories (Figure 4-3). The project is led by NOAA and the
U.S. Geological Survey, with contributions from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The inventory is a comprehensive, nationwide listing of high-accuracy topographic data, including lidar and IfSAR, and bathymetric data, including NOAA hydrographic surveys, multibeam data, and bathymetric lidar. The information provided for each elevation data set includes many attributes such as vertical accuracy, point spacing, and date of collection. Also provided are a point of contact for the data and a direct link to access the data, if available.

Digital Coast (NOAA Coastal Services Center)
The NOAA Coastal Services Center’s online data are provided via the Digital Coast (Figure 4-4) at www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast. This system provides data in several point, line, and raster formats. Additionally, only data from the user’s specified area of interest is delivered, which helps in minimizing download sizes and subsequent hardware resources. The interface includes a location search and a map search to define the area of interest. A detailed example of how to access this data source is provided in the Lidar Provisioning Guidance for the Digital Coast Data 
Loading Data into a GIS
Once the data have been accessed and downloaded as a point file, a raster file, or line file, they are commonly viewed and manipulated in a GIS system with additional data. This highlights the importance of specifying data in a format, projection, unit of measure, and datum that are compatible with the additional data being used, or at least knowing these values.
One of the most commonly used GIS systems is Esri’s ArcGIS. ArcGIS is a powerful and flexible environment for overlaying lidar-derived contours and surfaces with other common GIS data layers and performing analysis. Other GIS software packages that handle lidar data well include Global Mapper and AutoCad Map (Land Survey). Additionally, many lidar-specific software
packages are available as plug-ins for ArcGIS or as stand-alone programs. These packages, such as LAStools, provide sophisticated and often very efficient algorithms for data analysis and subsequent export of products to common GIS formats. Typically, the lidar-specific packages will offer more capability for working with the point data than the more general GIS or CAD oriented packages.
Lidar Data and ArcGIS
Esri’s ArcGIS for Desktop software has not traditionally been the easiest or the most robust system to use with lidar point data because of the complexity and sheer volume of points in typical lidar data sets. However, this software is the geospatial package that is used most widely within the coastal management community, so NOAA is focusing on it instead of other packages that may be more lidar-specific. With the release of ArcGIS 9.2, Esri introduced terrain data sets that provided limited capabilities to work with LAS files. The release of ArcGIS 10.1 introduced much more robust support for lidar point clouds, allowing users to incorporate LAS data into three container types: terrain data sets, mosaic data sets, and LAS data sets. The latter container type points to the LAS files on disk and allows users to render point clouds and triangulated surfaces in two and three dimensions, perform a variety of analytic operations, display filtered and classed points, edit points, and combine with breaklines during surface development. It is important to note that Esri exposes different levels of LAS functionality through different license levels and software extensions. The most useful functionality begins with the ArcGIS for Desktop Standard license (formerly ArcEditor), and the Spatial Analyst and 3D Analyst extensions add the capabilities for most data analysis and visualization tasks.
Working with lidar data in ArcGIS requires careful planning and consideration for compatibility. Lidar data are represented by several different data structures (e.g., points, lines, surfaces) and can be delivered to users in many different formats. However, not all formats are supported by ArcGIS, so users must understand which formats are compatible with their specific version and license level. For example, ASCII text or LAS files are the most common point formats, but only certain versions (i.e., ArcGIS 10.1 and later) can read and efficiently process LAS files, and a third-party extension would be needed to read the compressed LAZ version of LAS. Raster (gridded) data are sometimes available as Esri Grids, but not consistently; often ASCII grid or binary raster (nonproprietary) formats are the only available types and may require conversion to other formats before they can be used. Contours, on the other hand, are typically available as Esri-supported shapefiles.
Contours
Contours can be generated in ArcGIS (with Spatial Analyst or 3D Analyst) or downloaded as products from online sources (e.g., Digital Coast) as either .shp or .dxf formats. The following example will use Digital Coast-supplied contours. Creation of contours from a surface generated using Spatial Analyst will be covered later in the “Surfaces” section.
No matter how the contours are acquired, a surface is typically required to create them. The surface can be generated using several different specifications or techniques (see “Surfaces”), which can affect the location, geometry, and look of the contours. For example, in the Digital Coast Data Access Viewer interface, several different techniques are available to assign an
elevation to each raster cell from which the contours are created. Once generated, the process of displaying contours in ArcGIS is the same as for any .shp or dxf.
Unclassified data, or data not filtered to create a bare-earth data set, will produce extremely noisy and large contour data sets (Figure 4-5). If the lidar has not been processed to define ground points, the resulting contours will show vegetation and structures, as well as the bare ground (Figure 4-6A). This is a common problem; however, if the area is small, the contours that fall on houses can be removed (or classified) manually using photos, the lidar intensity images (Figure 4-6B), or obvious “house” signatures. The result is a product that may be more useful for examining ground features or modeling the local hydrology.

Even with classified data, the contours generated will probably lack the familiar “pleasing” look (Figure 4-7A). The look can be enhanced by “simplifying” or smoothing them in ArcGIS (Figure 4-7B); however, this will lower the accuracy of the contours. To fully improve the contours, while maintaining the same accuracy, additional information is required. Breaklines can be incorporated to bring out subtle features and improve visual appeal (Figure 4-7C and 4-7D).

There are several different standards for classifying the accuracy of contours, and lidar data are often collected to meet these specific standards. Table 4-1 is provided to show how the root mean square error (RMSE) accuracy (in centimeters) of lidar data compares to the generation of contours (in feet) based on different classes and standards. In general, most lidar is collected to meet or exceed the specifications for 2-foot contours at either ASPRS Class 1 or National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). And, again, this level of data accuracy will not provide “pleasing” contours; ancillary data and manual editing are required to produce pleasing contours within the accuracy guidelines provided.

Points
The other vector format is points, which is also the native lidar data format. The two common file formats for points are LAS and ASCII. There are size and format issues when using points in ArcGIS that can complicate the process. Newer releases of ArcGIS (9.2 and above) have new data containers that significantly aid in lidar point use. A lidar point file for a relatively small- sized area of investigation may hold 1 to 2 million points, which can, if in a shapefile format, slow the application appreciably. For this reason, it is important to either exclude outlying points from the project or select only the type of points you are interested in (e.g., if interested in topography only, minimize points to only ground classified, or last returns).
LAS point files are binary formats that can be read by ArcGIS (prior to version 10.1) but require preprocessing using ArcGIS tools or a third-party utility. Several free utilities are available to help bring LAS data into ArcGIS. The simplest is called LAS Reader for ArcGIS (www.geocue.com/support/utilities.html), which allows ArcGIS to read LAS files natively (Figure 4-8). With this utility, LAS files appear when viewing data files in ArcCatalog or when adding data in ArcMap. Another option is the LAStools LiDAR processing toolbox
(from http://rapidlasso.com) that allows leveraging the efficient collection of LAStools command-line tools from ArcGIS. The toolbox is simply added to ArcToolbox, and different processing tools are available to generate three-dimensional multi-point and point shapefiles, contours, DEMs, and more. Note that LAStools are freely available for evaluation purposes, but licensing restrictions apply for certain use cases (see http://lastools.org/LICENSE.txt).
The fields of the attribute tables for files loaded as a .dbf (Figure 4-9) and with LAS Reader (Figure 4-10) highlight the differences among techniques for importing the data into the GIS. The LAS Reader and the LAStools “las2shp” programs assign the points a 3D coordinate (PointZ; Figures 4-10); the database method does not (Figure 4-9) but includes an elevation field in the attribute table that can be selected to define a symbology or create a surface.

Once points have been added, they can be used independently to symbolize elevation (Figure 4-11) or used for further analysis with one of the ArcGIS extensions to create surfaces or contours (See “Surfaces”). A simple DEM (Figure 4-12) can be created by using ArcToolbox (Conversion Tools > To Raster > Feature to Raster) if the Spatial Analyst or 3D Analyst extensions are not available. Intensity can also be symbolized (Figure 4-13) if available in the point attributes to create a “pseudo image.”

Surfaces (Grids) – The most common lidar product is a grid or raster elevation surface. Surfaces developed from lidar data highlight the intrinsic value of the data (i.e., high accuracy over large areas), and are the basis for multiple forms of derived products.
Several data monikers or descriptions are used to explain elevation products or surfaces. The three terms often referred to when describing an elevation product are
•	a digital elevation model (DEM),
•	a digital terrain model (DTM), and
•	a digital surface model (DSM).
The term “DEM” is typically used as a general description of an elevation surface. It is often used in conjunction with a specific or additional description, such as a bare-earth DEM or topo- bathy DEM, which provides further information. A “DTM” is commonly a bare-earth product, or one that is intended to provide a best representation of the terrain, and may incorporate ancillary information (i.e., breaklines) to better represent the surface. A “DSM” is a more loosely defined term and can include any type of product that represents a surface, whether bare earth or the surface along the tops of trees.
Most elevation applications are best served by bare-earth DEMs or DTMs. As shown earlier, this requires removal of points falling on non-terrain features (e.g., trees, cars, houses). This type of process is, for the most part, handled using lidar-specific software; however, there are some
 
lidar-specific software extensions that work within ArcGIS that can be used to classify points and create a bare-earth DEM.
ArcGIS, with either 3D Analyst or Spatial Analyst, can interpolate DEMs from point data, and ArcGIS without any extensions can read and display several different DEM formats created with separate software. Analysis of the DEM (e.g., calculating height differences, generating aspect and slope grids, generating 3D profiles, or creating contours), however, requires one of the extensions.
As mentioned, ArcGIS can natively handle several gridded formats including GeoTiffs (.tif), Esri Grids, and ERDAS Imagine (.img) files. For other common formats, the “Conversion Tools” toolbox has most of the grid or raster import capabilities needed. The most commonly used for lidar data include the ASCII to Raster and Float (.flt) to Raster tools. When possible, it is advised that float or natively handled formats be used.
If any sort of analysis is planned, most users will need to have 3D Analyst or Spatial Analyst. Figures 4-14 and 4-15 were created in ArcGIS using 3D Analyst to first create a TIN (triangulated irregular network) data set and then convert to a grid (raster). The data were taken from a point data set that had been classified. The DSM (Figure 4-14) was created using all the points, and the DTM (Figure 4-15) was created by selecting only those with a classification of “2” (Figure 4-10), which is the standard class for ground points.

Further “visualization” analysis of the surface in ArcGIS with the use of either 3D Analyst or Spatial Analyst may include creating a hillshade image (Figure 4-16). Hillshading brings out the more subtle aspects of the data and can help highlight smaller features and also flaws or collection aspects of the data. For example, the pattern of horizontal lines running at about 45 degrees in Figure 4-16 probably represents the scanning direction of the lidar sensor. The data have a “corn row” appearance and may be the result of a slight problem in the inertial measurement instrument (IMU). The corn rows are only a couple of centimeters but show up quite well—for better or worse. Contours made from these data will probably have a zig-zag appearance (especially in flatter areas). Hillshade rasters created in ArcGIS do not have “elevation” values; rather they are just black and white images.
Hillshade layers can, however, be made semi-transparent and be draped over the elevation data to create a “composite” DEM (Figure 4-17). In addition, composite hillshaded images can also be created by draping orthoimages over an elevation grid (Figure 4-18).


Finally, a common analysis of a surface is generation of contours (Figure 4-19), which could include generation of a shoreline (e.g., an elevation representing mean high water or mean sea level). As mentioned before, contours generated from lidar data will not typically have a smooth appearance, even if using only bare earth, since the data contain significant high frequency “noise” (i.e., lots of closely spaced points with slightly varying elevation values).
 
Contours can be generated using either 3D Analyst or Spatial Analyst (Surface > Contour). While contours are a popular product, it should be noted that much of the data is being lost and that contours are a “simplification” technique.

These are examples of some simple “visualization” techniques that can benefit most applications; further analysis will depend largely on the specific use or application of the data. Three-dimensional visualization is rapidly becoming more common and does bring a more intuitive aspect to the data.
Metadata
Metadata are integral for maximizing the use of lidar data, since metadata typically provide the collection parameters, accuracy, and contacts for further information, which may include full collection and quality control reports. The primary aspects of metadata are similar to other data and include the description, data quality, spatial reference information, and contacts. It answers the “what,” “where,” “when,” and “how good” questions. It is important to keep in mind that lidar is generally collected over small project sizes and can be collected at multiple times; thus, keeping track of data set variables is important if working on an area that overlaps several data sets. Metadata provide this information, including contacts that are best suited to answer data questions not covered. For example, if a noticeable offset between two lidar data sets occurs, the metadata will help determine what steps should be taken to fix the problem or who could provide additional insight. Even when fully compliant metadata are available, there are aspects that may not be covered and can only be determined through points of contact.
Summary
Using lidar data in some GIS programs does have inherent difficulties that stem from the large amount of data that is provided for even small areas. Points can be loaded in several formats;
however, the sheer number of them can create usage problems. A simple solution is to get the data as a pre-made DEM (raster) or as contours (lines); both are generally easier to use than the raw points. If custom surfaces are desired, the points can be used to create surfaces in some programs or with additional extensions in ArcGIS. Once surfaces are created, different analyses can be performed for both visualization and analytic purposes. To maximize the use of the analyses and operate within the data set’s limits, it is important to examine the metadata for the accuracy and, also, the processes used to generate the raw data. This chapter highlighted Esri’s ArcGIS platform and associated methods given its widespread use within the coastal management community.
 
5.	Data Customization and Specification
Overview
Certain user or customer specifications can help maximize the data for specific applications. Lidar data, like most remote sensing information, can be highly customized to satisfy a certain use. The downside, however, is that there can be a host of “options” to wade through, both in use and in purchasing. This chapter focuses on two attributes of lidar point data that are user- selectable and directly influence the form and representation of derived elevation products such as DEMs and contours. These attributes are discussed in the context of the standard LAS format used for lidar point clouds. The chapter goes on to describe the use of breaklines in refining lidar products. There is a thorough discussion of data accuracy and consistency, because the most important option when purchasing lidar data, and often the primary cost driver, is the accuracy requirement. The chapter concludes with an exploration of user- selectable options in NOAA’s Digital Coast Data Access Viewer and considerations for those who seek to obtain lidar data from this source.
Data Attributes
Several references to classified data have been made in the earlier sections of this guide; classification is an example of an important attribute in the data set. Use of data attributes requires an understanding of what they are and, to some degree, where they reside in the file. The most common lidar point cloud file format is the LAS format (ASPRS, 2009). There are two primary “sections” of an LAS file: the header and the data. The header is accessible using most lidar software, including free software. The information in Box 1 is an example of the first portion of the header where file information is stored. Box 2 is an example of additional header information, including georeferencing information that may be provided as variable length records that follow the primary header information.
Following the header and variable length records are the data. The data are in binary format (as is the entire file), which cannot be read with most text editors. Below is an example of three point records contained in a LAS file, with attributes and their values. In some cases, the
originating lidar system may not generate data for all the fields; for example, scan angle is primarily applicable to oscillating mirror systems.
Note that there are no decimal numbers in the x,y,z portion of the data. The decimal portions are handled in the header—in the “X,Y,Z Scale Factors” line, which in this case is 0.0100, 0.0100, 0.0010. Return number (ret #) and number of returns (#ret) provide relative information on how many “objects” the laser pulse hit (Figure 5-1) and which hit the value is from. The “scandir” field describes which way the scan mirror was moving (left or right). The “edge” value represents the last point in the scan direction (i.e., last point before the scan mirror turns around and goes the other way). “Class” refers to the points classification (see below); “angle” was discussed above. “User data” is an open field that can be used by the lidar vendor for its use. “Pt_src_id” is typically the flight line and “gps_time” is the time the point was collected.
Return Numbers
Along with higher pulse rates, the ability to discern multiple returns is a major advance in lidar technology (Figure 5-1). Early lidar systems provided single or first and last returns only, but contemporary systems are capable of providing at least three returns per pulse. The return number and its order (i.e., 1 of 2, 1 of 1, 2 of 4) provide important information for follow-on classifications; for example, any middle returns are very unlikely to be ground and multiple returns typically will be in vegetation—not on structures.

The following figures (Figures 5-2 to 5-4) highlight the different types of surfaces that multiple returns can produce. A surface developed from all returns (Figure 5-2) is “noisy” because, depending on the binning and interpolation methods used, it may include returns from the ground, mid-canopy, and top-of-canopy. A surface created only from “last returns” produces a slightly smoother surface (Figure 5-3) but still contains points falling on buildings and dense trees and vegetation; last-
return data should not be confused with bare-earth data. Using only the last of multiple returns
(Figure 5-4) removes nearly all structures, except ones under trees, and most vegetation, although some lower-lying vegetation remains. It also removes bare-earth points from open areas. None of these examples provides a bare-earth product; however, the “last-return only” surface produces the closest approximation, although it misses a significant amount of information.

Editing lidar point data to improve final DEM accuracy and usability is usually conducted within the LAS data workflow. Production of classified data models allows all the original points to be retained while affording the user flexibility to select specific classes of points for final surface generation. Classification of lidar data is usually undertaken to produce a point set that
represents only the returns that hit the “bare ground” (Figure 5-5). The remaining points are typically moved to an “unclassified” class. When creating a DEM, it is then possible to remove all “extraneous” points to create the best possible representation of a bare-earth surface (Figure 5-5). This represents the simplest classification case; more specification can be accomplished, and classification of features (e.g., trees, houses) is becoming a common trend.
There is an American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) classification scheme that is used by most lidar producers (Box 3). The primary values are 1, 2, and 9. Water is an especially important consideration for coastal areas, since the water is essentially flat and can often be classified as “ground” in automated processes (Figure 5-6); this can hold true for ponds and other water bodies as well.


More and more, the use of classifications is expanding to include differentiation between vegetation and structures or between tall and short vegetation (Figure 5-7). From these classifications, hybrid or customized DEMs can be produced to represent built infrastructure or vegetation models. Additionally, the data can be used in characterizing different types of land cover; for example, the average or maximum heights of vegetation for a specific area can be compared to other areas or the entire data set.

Breaklines
Point classification and filtration greatly improve the final representation of terrain, but additional editing and information is required to produce hydrologically and cartographically correct DEMs. This is typically done through the introduction of three-dimensional breaklines. Breaklines are features that represent significant breaks in slope or that delineate edges of features such as rivers, bays, and other water bodies. One of the most common uses of breaklines is in the process of hydrologic correction in DEMS.
There are several types of hydrologic correction, including hydrologic enforcement and flattening; hydrologic enforcement creates a network of water bodies with a general down- slope flow, hydrologic flattening creates a more pleasing appearance to the DEM by making water bodies flat. These processes are performed because 1) lidar returns from water surfaces are neither consistent nor accurate and therefore shouldn’t necessarily be used to define water
surface elevations or boundaries; 2) lidar collections are not always timed to acquire data at specific tide stages or water levels; and 3) ultimately because it is important that hydrologic features be represented accurately to facilitate successful hydraulic and hydrologic modeling activities.
At a national level, the USGS National Geospatial Program requires that all the DEMs in the National Elevation Dataset (NED) have their inland and coastal water bodies flattened.
Breaklines are used in the DEM development process to accomplish this. In flattened DEMs, breakline values are typically set at the lowest ground point in lakes and using gradients in rivers that preserve bank elevations at their measured elevation. Coastal values are typically chosen at a value that maintains as much data as possible. In some cases the bare-earth lidar points (Class 2) directly adjacent to the breaklines are reclassified to “Ignored Ground” (class value = 10) and excluded during surface generation. This produces a smoother transition from upland to the shoreline.
Lidar systems and processing algorithms do not inherently collect breaklines required for hydro- flattening. However, they can be generated separately through a variety of techniques using the lidar points or ancillary data. In cases where breaklines are used in DEM development, they are typically delivered as PolylineZ or PolygonZ Esri feature classes (either in shapefile or geodatabase formats). The Lidar Processing report that accompanies these lidar data deliverables should also include a description of the method used for breakline collection.
Accuracy Specification and Tests
As mentioned in the previous section, the accuracy specification is an important piece of information and is commonly found in the metadata. In addition, most data sets also have an accompanying report on the collection parameters and data quality (Table 5-1). The most common way to express accuracy is through the root mean square error (RMSE). The RMSE is analogous to the standard deviation of a non-biased data set (i.e., a data set that has errors equally distributed above and below zero), such that about 68% of the data would fall within the range of the RMSE or 1 standard deviation. The other term that is common is Accuracyz. This generally equates to 2 standard deviations (with non-biased data), such that 95% of the data falls within the Accuracyz value. For example, a data set with an Accuracyz of 25 centimeters should have 95% of the data fall within 25 centimeters of their true value.
As described in chapter 3, the accuracy values are calculated using ground control points (GCP) that have been surveyed throughout the collection areas and have accurate elevation values. The lidar data are used to create a TIN surface that is compared to the GCP point data. A TIN surface is used because there is very little chance that the GCP points will exactly coincide with the lidar data points, and a TIN is a simple, non-biased method for interpolating a value from the nearest points.
In most cases, a minimum of 20 GCP points are collected per land cover category. This allows one point to fail the vertical accuracy specification without causing the entire dataset to fail the 95% confidence limit. An example of the analysis is presented in Table 5-1 and Figure 5-8, with separate accuracy values and population graphs calculated for bare earth, forested, scrub/shrub, weeds and crops, and urban areas. Note that in this case there were 166 points.
system and the collection parameters. The accuracies in the other land covers generally relate to how well the processing was done to remove vegetation and structures from bare-earth points. The urban or built category is also tested separately because very dark and very bright surfaces (e.g., roads) absorb or reflect laser pulses in ways that introduce inaccuracies in these areas.
Use of the data for specific applications may depend on the accuracy of the data for specific land covers. For example, shoreline delineation requires only a high level of accuracy in the bare-earth category (FVA), whereas flood mapping requires that both bare earth and forested areas have accuracies suitable for creating a specific contour interval (CVA). If a data set has good bare-earth accuracy but was poorly classified for vegetation, then it may not be usable for flood mapping; however, the data set will still work well for shoreline delineation.
High accuracy comes at a price and should be specified based on the needs of the project or likely uses. When considering “likely uses,” it is probable that future uses will benefit from higher accuracies, so it is generally better to ask for higher accuracies to increase the shelf life of the data set.
Qualitative Review of Lidar Data
Unlike the clearly defined accuracy requirements, the qualitative aspect of the data is a bit more subjective. While, it does not commonly receive the same amount of attention on the front end, it is a critical check for the successful use of the data. In essence, the accuracy assessment tests only 200 to 300 points in a data set of a billion points, so the qualitative review can be seen as a test of the other billion or so points. There are, however, no specified qualitative accuracy procedures, so familiarity with lidar data in general and the location and intended use in particular are typically necessary. Since it is a “fuzzy” analysis, it is generally best to have it performed by a third party, the purchaser, or a user group.
Some of the most common qualitative “errors” are flightline mismatches where points from adjacent flightlines do not match and generate the appearance of a systematic offset (Figure 5- 9), high frequency noise—also called “corn rows” (Figure 5-10), formatting (Figure 5-11), misclassification (Figure 5-12), and data holidays or voids (Figure 5-13). While many of these problems can be fixed, corn rows are more difficult to remedy. It should be mentioned that there are no “perfect” data sets, but there is generally a level at which the data set loses some of its usability; that threshold should be considered when specifying the data.

Data Attribute Specification in Digital Coast
While there are many sites for downloading data, the Digital Coast Data Access Viewer provides the ability to specify data classifications (for data that have been processed for bare earth) and returns (for data with more than single returns) when provisioning the data (NOAA, 2011). This information is also available when requesting LAS files, although with a LAS file it is generally better to get all the data and do the point selection on the user side (i.e., turn off non-ground points if the software being used can perform this function).
When the data have not been classified, but bare earth is sought, the bin method, cell size, and returns values can be specified to decrease the number of non-ground points. Use of the “minimum” bin option in the specification along with a larger cell size helps remove vegetation and other non-ground features such as houses, and if contours are being sought the smoothing may be preferable to higher resolution spikes. However, there comes a point when the smoothing results in a diminished return. The gains in feature removal are offset by loss in resolution, and the level where any advantage is gained will largely depend on the intended use.
As an example, several iterations of data sets were created by progressively increasing grid cell sizes and selecting the minimum points in each cell (Figure 5-14). At a 5-meter cell size, all the coastal features, houses, and vegetation largely remain and the data provide a significant level of detail. Expanding the cell size to 10 meters removes many of the houses, although some remain, and begins to remove some tall vegetation (top right corner). At 10 meters many of the subtle land features are still present, providing a fair amount of detail. Expanding to a 20-meter cell size removes all the houses, and bare-earth surface is essentially all that remains. There is, however, a significant loss of detail in that subtle features such as the dune are largely removed—and the overall elevation is likely a bit low since small depressions within a cell become the cell’s overall value. Using this iterative approach, a 15-meter cell size may prove to be the most appropriate for removing structures and trees while maintaining a level of accuracy and enough topographic information for many environmental and habitat applications.

There are other specification variations in Digital Coast that can be employed to maximize the information for specific uses; the previous example is, however, one of the more common.
Fortunately, newer data sets are being produced with a wider audience in mind so that the data are more user-friendly (i.e., bare earth has been classified so that features can be extracted more easily) and can be used for many different applications and analyses.
Summary
Lidar data are evolving from simple x,y,z points to classified data sets with unique attributes and classification schemes. The LAS format is designed to handle the common attributes, data parameters, and classifications while still maximizing data storage efficiency. Noting or defining the data quality is paramount when acquiring or downloading lidar data; the level of data quality is a major cost driver. Accuracy assessments provide important information for defining specific data use. Qualitative assessments provide a broad check of the data’s overall use.
Classifications, most often used to define bare-earth products, are increasingly being used to define features. In data sets where classifications are absent, some selection (last returns) and resampling (increasing grid sizes) can be performed to begin approximating a bare-earth product. The USGS’s Base Lidar Specification – Version 13 (USGS NGP, 2010) is a valuable resource for organizations interested in purchasing airborne lidar data. The document contains base specifications (i.e., minimum parameters) and recommendations for lidar acquisitions to help ensure consistency among lidar data sets and improve data utility.
6.	Examples of Coastal Lidar Applications
Overview
The results of an analysis can vary when using the same base data if different processing techniques are used; this is both an advantage and a disadvantage to the use of lidar data. This variance stems from the massive amount of data and the need to resample or group them (i.e., grid them). On the positive side, a significant amount of data can be removed to get only the information sought; on the negative side, the techniques used to sample the data will or could vary and create incompatible results. Some examples are provided to show how data can be specified to maximize a specific use and also how this may create variability within one data set.
Shoreline Mapping
Lidar coverage is expanding rapidly along the U.S. shoreline, and as a result lidar data are increasingly being used for shoreline mapping, including defining shoreline positions and quantifying rates of shoreline change. Shoreline—and its many tidal datum variations—is commonly referenced as a boundary component in legal descriptions, as the point of origin for jurisdictional boundaries, and as the boundary between public and private ownership (Figure 6- 1). These various definitions of shorelines are based on water levels that are influenced by tides and currents.
The different shorelines shown above have traditionally been inferred from various indicators or proxies such as vegetation lines, dune lines, beach scarps, wet‒dry lines, and more (White and others, 2011). Long-term water level records have led to the development of datum-based shorelines that rely on known relationships between tidal, orthometric, and ellipsoidal vertical datums.
Changes in shorelines through processes of accretion and erosion can be analyzed by measuring differences in past and present shoreline locations (Figure 6-2). This information is used to quantify erosion rates and adjust setback regulations.


NOAA’s National Geodetic Survey, or NGS, started testing lidar data to map shorelines in 2000 and incorporated a lidar-derived shoreline in a chart for the first time in 2004. One of the main benefits of using lidar to map shorelines is that tide-coordination requirements are not as stringent as with the traditional photogrammetric procedures: it is typically only necessary to collect data below a certain tide stage, rather than within a narrow tide window (White and others, 2011). Topographic lidar provides multiple elevation readings per square meter but cannot penetrate the water surface (due to the laser’s wavelength). This results in a very densely sampled “dry” area on most coastlines but a lack of information seaward of water’s edge at the time of acquisition. Bathymetric lidar can, with a different wavelength, penetrate the water surface and provide depth or “bathy” information out to about 70 meters in clear water. In areas with highly turbid waters or breaking waves, however, the penetration depth is
on the order of feet or less. For most shoreline extraction and coastal science applications, it is more important to have high-resolution, seamless data across the backshore, intertidal, and shallow nearshore zones. There are several combined topographic and bathymetric lidar systems that have been used extensively to map shoreline and nearshore areas. Combined topographic-bathymetric lidar data sets, such as those collected by the Joint Airborne Lidar Bathymetry Technical Center of Expertise (JALBTCX), provide the critical elevation data required to produce datum-based shorelines. However, the spacing for bathymetric points is fairly wide compared to the tight spacing of topographic points, and there are often large gaps in areas with significant wave action and high turbidity (Figure 6-3). It is thus often preferable to derive shorelines using topographic lidar that was collected at a low tide stage (e.g., mean lower low water (MLLW)). Collecting it at a low tide stage permits higher shorelines to be mapped using a single data set (e.g., mean sea level (MSL), mean high water (MHW)). However, in practice, it is extremely challenging to map MLLW from topo-only lidar data. This is because it is operationally challenging in many project sites to acquire the data at a sufficiently low tide stage that the MLLW line is exposed (i.e., above water) throughout the project site.
Furthermore, the data in the vicinity of the MLLW shoreline are often sparse and noisy, due to low backscatter from wet surfaces when operating at near-infrared wavelengths. And finally, many algorithms are unstable near the edges of coverage in a data set. These challenges are best overcome with seamless topo-bathy data generated from systems configured for such environments, though using these systems does not guarantee good, continuous coverage across the land-water interface (Parrish, 2012).

For the purposes of mapping a specific shoreline (e.g., MLLW, MHW), lidar-based procedures help eliminate some of the subjectivity and interpretation biases common with photogrammetric techniques (Espy, 2003; White and others, 2011). Once a base DEM has been created from the lidar points, different users can take the information and create a repeatable shoreline based on a specific elevation; this is the advantage of a complete digital coastal elevation model (Guenther, 2007). There are many ways to create a DEM from lidar data. In some cases the user has control over the types of routines or methods used to generate the DEM, and in other cases, the user is provided with a pre-made DEM. NOAA’s NGS published its lidar-based shoreline mapping workflow in White and others (2011). The workflow begins with lidar point data (which were collected using strict requirements) that are processed and ultimately converted to a gridded DEM (Figure 6-4). The use of NOAA’s VDatum tool is a critical component of this workflow, as it makes possible the transformations between tidal, orthometric, and ellipsoidal vertical datums. The creation of a DEM from lidar data can be performed using different interpolation routines—each with its own advantages and disadvantages—but the NGS methodology serves to generate a nationally consistent datum- based shoreline.

As with DEM interpolation methods, there are different techniques for extracting contours. The NGS method uses linear interpolation to produce consistent and accurate shorelines. The same contouring process that was used to extract the MHW contour was also used to extract the MLLW contour (Figure 6-6). In both cases, the shorelines are displayed on top of aerial imagery that was collected around the predicted time of MHW and MLLW, respectively.
 
In summary, this discussion on shoreline mapping focused on the NGS workflow for lidar-based shoreline mapping. As such, topo-bathy lidar points were gathered from NOAA’s Digital Coast and were transformed to tidal datums using the VDatum software. DEMs were then created for each tidal datum with a 1.5 meter grid resolution. Shoreline contours were created from the DEMs and presented in the graphics.
Inundation Mapping
Inundation, whether from sea-level rise or storm surge, is a common coastal application using elevation data. Lidar data provide the accuracy to both model and delineate the potential extent of flooding from different forms of inundation due to the high accuracy of the data and the ability to resolve small features that influence flow paths. In sea-level rise scenarios, the lidar data can be used to model topographic change—or morphologic change—that would be generated from a nearly uniform rise in water level and also to identify areas that are potentially susceptible to flooding. Coastal flooding from storms represents a rise in water level that is not uniform. Lidar data can be input in surface water models as well as map flooding extent.
Storm surge is typically modeled using either the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model or the Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) model. There are advantages and disadvantages to both models, and lidar data can be, and have been, incorporated into both models. The DEM grid that the ADCIRC model uses generally has a higher resolution than the SLOSH model, but ADCIRC cannot yet be run operationally for oncoming storms. Of course, neither SLOSH nor ADCIRC run at or near the resolution of even the coarsest lidar data. The
output of the SLOSH model is an “envelope” of water that includes water depth (Figure 6-6). When these outputs are combined with a lidar-derived topographic surface (Figure 6-7), flood areas, extents, and depths are more precisely defined than those generated using the “best available” regional data (Figure 6-8) that, in this case, has a lower spatial resolution and also poorer accuracy.
Wetland Habitat Delineation
Elevation is an extremely important variable in defining coastal wetland habitats (Figure 6-9), and in the face of changing sea levels, evolution in marsh micro-habitats (i.e., low marsh vs. high marsh) will depend on the sea-level change rates and ability of the marsh to accrete vertically (i.e., increase elevation through deposition of sediment and detritus). If the system lacks sediment or biogenic (e.g., plant material, shells) deposition, then the marsh habitats will migrate to higher elevations, if possible, as sea-level rises. In a system where sediment or biogenic deposition can match rises in sea-level, the marshes and their micro-habitats will continue to maintain an equilibrium. In either case, new marsh will be created, if environmental variables permit, where uplands once existed.

For example, in a report on wetland habitats in the greater Charleston, South Carolina, area, Kana and others (1988) defined the marsh habitats, species, and their relative elevation zones (Figure 6-10) and found that there were fairly narrow elevation zones for many of the species. Use of these field-measured distributions and lidar ground elevations may help further define the spatial zones (elevation based) for various species or greater marsh habitats; and, significantly, what the extent of zones would be under varying marsh accretion or sea-level rise scenarios.

Wetlands pose a particular challenge when working with lidar data because the upright vegetation is dense and near to the ground, and the marsh surface is partially composed of it. The following example, using lidar data from Charleston County, South Carolina, examines the use of cell size to determine the bare-earth surface in a marsh area. Even if the data are classified, the traditional routines used typically do not completely remove marsh vegetation from the data (Figure 6-11).
The lidar data were downloaded from Digital Coast using the minimum value grid method (i.e., lowest point within each grid cell) for several different grid cell sizes to approach the issue of effectively removing marsh vegetation (see Schmid and others, 2011). The cell sizes were progressively increased (Figure 6-12) to maximize the potential for capturing a point that struck the substrate (i.e., mud) rather than the flora. As shown previously, the trade-off is a decreased level of detail and imparting a potential low bias when increasing the cell size with the minimum value selection method.
 
The lidar surface data from different cell sizes (Figure 6-12) highlights the gradual loss of resolution. The marsh profiles (Figure 6-13) from the transect in Figure 6-12A demonstrate how the increasingly large cell sizes effectively remove higher points, which are likely related to points falling on the upright marsh vegetation. The total difference between the data sets is generally only about six to eight inches—but in a marsh that difference can be large in terms of habitat zones (i.e., low vs. high marsh species). For example, when using the elevation taken from previous work (Kana and others) to map low and high marsh vegetation zones (Figure
6-14), the differences from the 3 resolutions are quite dramatic.

Further work can be done to begin looking at marsh elevation or habitat zones from different dates, using the same gridding scheme. It should be noted, however, that when comparing different data sets, there is an inherent error in the data of approximately 0.5 to 1 foot. That being said, the relative error (i.e., the error between points in the same area, not the error with respect to a set datum) should be significantly less.
A major issue in mapping the marsh surface is removing points that fall on vegetation while still honoring the slight variations in the surface. The example above (Figure 6-14) was taken from a data set that has a moderate point spacing of about 1.5 meters. A more densely sampled data set would increase the number of points striking the marsh surface over a certain area, and smaller bins could be used. While lidar is among the highest-resolution, highest-accuracy elevation data commercially available, use of the data must respect the inherent limitations of the data set. Many limitations can be overcome through additional processing, although some errors may only be minimized.
Summary
Highly accurate, high-resolution lidar data have particular utility in coastal settings where terrain is generally flat and subtle elevation changes often have significant importance. These examples represent only a small subset of applications of lidar in coastal environments. Other potential applications of lidar include forestry, geology, watershed and water quality studies, transportation, safety, cadastral mapping, and archaeology. As lidar is increasingly available for coastal areas, applications that relied on coarse data are being improved with the use of lidar data. One example of this is the ongoing work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Risk MAP program, where more accurate data are used to generate new flood maps.

Airborne Topographic LiDAR

6- Technology Overview. Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) System, sometimes referred to as Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS), is a remote sensing technique used to measure the distance to an object by determining the time of flight for an emitted laser beam. A scanning mechanism (such as an oscillating mirror) is normally employed to steer a series of laser pulses (typically over 100 KHz) over a wide area from an airborne platform. All airborne LiDAR systems use enabling
technologies such as Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to determine the location and orientation of the remote sensor located on the airborne platform (see Figure 1-1). The resulting data are typically used to measure topography of the land surface, including bare earth topography that excludes buildings and vegetation.
a.	Operating Principles.
Although most commercially-available Airborne LiDAR Systems use a pulsed laser source, there are other operating modes of laser-based remote sensing systems. For example, a laser system can be characterized as a continuous wave (CW) laser system that transmits a continuous signal, and ranging is determined by modulating the
intensity of the laser light. In such a
 
system, a sinusoidal signal is received with a time delay. The travel time is directly proportional to the phase difference between the received and
 

 
transmitted signal. Pulsed laser systems, on the other hand, transmit a series of laser pulses and measure the round-trip time of each laser pulse that scattered back to the optical receiver. The distance (or range) to the target is determined by the one-way time of flight of the laser pulse multiplied by the speed of light.


(1)	Laser. The laser ranging unit in airborne laser scanning will include the actual laser; the transmitting and receiving optics; and the receiver with its detector, time counter and digitizing unit.

(2)	Laser Wavelength. For topographic mapping using airborne laser scanning, where high energy pulses are required to perform distance measurements over long ranges, only certain types of solid-state, semiconductor, and fiber lasers have the specific characteristics – ability to produce high intensity collimated beams – that are necessary to carry out these operations. Nearly all airborne topographic LiDAR systems that use solid-state crystalline material such a neodymium- doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) lasers operate in the near-infrared wavelength range (typically 1064 nm). Fiber lasers (sometimes referred to as glass lasers) operating at or near 1550 nm have also been routinely used, though these systems operate at lower power levels and cannot reach the same operating altitudes as the 1064 nm laser sensors. Lasers have also been developed to operate at 905 nm, but are not very popular for airborne LiDAR applications due to their low- intensity returns over saturated sediments. Another class of lasers operates at the frequency- doubled blue-green wavelength of 532 nm. These sensors are typically used in bathymetric and topobathymetric applications because the green-wavelength laser is able to penetrate through the water column under certain conditions; see Chapter 7 for more details.

(3)	Pulse Energy, Pulse Width, and Beam Divergence. The pulse energy, measured in micro Joules (µJ), is simply the total energy of the laser pulse. Pulse duration, measured in nanoseconds (ns), is typically defined as the time during which the laser output pulse power remains continuously above half its maximum value. Beam divergence, measured in milliradians (mrad), refers to the increase in beam diameter that occurs as the distance between the laser instrument and a plane that intersects the beam axis increases. The pulse energy of topographic LiDAR systems are typically low (10-100 µJ) to allow for a tightly focused beam with low beam divergence that is also eye safe. Bathymetric LiDAR systems have pulse energies up to 7 mJ, which are typically much higher than the near-infrared lasers used in topographic applications. The higher power is needed for the laser pulse to penetrate through the water column to map the bottom. The bathymetric sensors with very high laser pulse power also have a large footprint so that the energy is spread across a larger area for eye-safety reasons. The pulse width determines the range resolution of the pulse in multiple return systems (explained below), or the minimum distance between consecutive returns from a pulse. Traditionally, pulse widths for topographic systems have been in range of about 10 ns. This means that there is a “blind spot” of about 1 meter along the laser path behind each received LiDAR return. Newer laser technology has enabled the use of much shorter pulse widths (1-2 ns) for topographic and topobathymetric applications. For topobathymetric applications, a short pulse width laser enables the separation of a return from the water surface and bottom in very shallow water depths. This limits the effective measurement depth to >0.5m for threshold detect topobathy LiDAR systems.
 



(4)	Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF). The PRF, measured in kHz, is the number of pulses emitted by the laser instrument in 1 second. Older instruments emitted a few thousand pulses per second. Modern systems can support frequencies of 400 kHz and newer technologies are now enabling 2 lasers channels to be used in conjunction with the same scanning mirror, thereby producing effective PRF of 800 kHz. Many systems allow different settings for the PRF. This is usually done to allow the systems to fly at different flight altitudes. The PRF is directly related to the point density on the target. For example, a system operating at 167 kHz from the same flying altitude will have higher number of returns than when operating at 100 kHz. Equivalently, a high PRF system can generate desired return densities by operating on an aircraft that flies higher and faster than an aircraft carrying a lower PRF system, thereby reducing flying time and acquisition costs when weather conditions allow for higher flying altitudes.

b.	Scanner. The primary goal of the scanning technique is to create a wide swath with consistent along- and across-track point spacing, and reliable and accurate elevations for the entire swath. Several scanning techniques have been used in airborne LiDAR systems. In theory there are no special reasons why one scanning technique is preferable to another, although scan patterns that facilitate constant incident angle on the terrain can reduce data voids related to dynamic range of the receiving optics. The most common scanning techniques are the Oscillating Mirror and Rotating Mirror.

(1)	Oscillating Mirrors. In systems using an oscillating mirror, the mirror rotates back and forth between limited extents, producing a zigzag (i.e. sinusoidal pattern) line on the surface of the target area (Figure 1-2). The mirror is always pointing downwards towards the ground so data collection can be continuous and theoretically all pulses of the laser can be used. The field of view and scan rate can be set by the operator prior to acquisition. Changing the field of view provides additional flexibility as it allows laser pulses to be collected over a shorter span (denser data ) or a wider span (sparser data). Although the oscillating mirror is the most widely used scanning mechanism for airborne LiDAR
systems, there are inherent disadvantages of using the oscillating mirror principle. The changing velocity and acceleration of the mirror as it oscillates from one end to the other causes unequal spacing of the laser pulses on the target. The point density increases along the edges of the scan where the mirror slows down, and decreases along
 
the center in the along-scan direction. The forward motion of the aircraft causes the zig-zag pattern with varying point spacing along the edges of the scan in the cross-scan direction. Manufacturers have solved these problems by essentially ignoring the outlier
 

 


points on a scan and modeling the distortions caused by changing speed using a computer algorithm.

(2)	Rotating Mirrors. The rotating mirror is another commonly used scanning mechanism for airborne LiDAR systems. In this approach, the mirror is rotated continuously at a constant velocity in one direction producing a parallel line scan (Figure 1-3). The constant velocity ensures that there are no acceleration type errors encountered in the oscillating mirror scanner. The point spacing is also more regular both along and across the scan. However, the biggest disadvantage is that observations cannot be taken during a significant time during each mirror rotation when the mirror is pointing away from the target. Typically, 30-40% of the emitted laser pulses are not aimed at the target area and are essentially lost to the scanning mechanism.


 
(3)	Other Scanning Patterns. Other scanning mechanisms less commonly used include the push broom (fiber scanning) pattern where the laser pulsed energy is transmitted into one of the fibers arranged in a circle producing a nutating scan pattern (Figure 1-4) and the Palmer scanner that produces an elliptical scanning pattern with
redundant data that can be used for calibration or to get a forward and aft view of the same target Geopositioning. Calibrating LiDAR data begins with the proper installation/mounting of the LiDAR unit, GPS antenna, and IMU sensor on the aircraft, and the precise measurement of offsets in the x, y, and z directions between each of these sensors. The IMU usually serves as the point of reference and the precise distance between all units are measured with respect to the IMU. The precise location of the GPS base station, the antenna height, and the phase center information are required to process the differential GPS-IMU trajectory. The GPS-IMU trajectory is the precise aircraft trajectory that contains the 6 positioning and orientation
 



parameters: x, y, z, pitch, roll, heading; along with a unique timestamp. The position information is derived from post-processing the aircraft GPS receiver data along with the GPS base station data using specialized differential GPS (DGPS) software. The LiDAR positions are calculated at 0.5 second steps. In a second step, an integrated position and orientation solution is calculated with the DGPS-position data and the IMU data by another software module, yielding position and orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) angles to better than one-hundredth of a degree. The IMU measurement rate is typically 200 Hz; the trajectory values are usually maintained at the same rate as the IMU, i.e. 200 records per second. Once the GPS and IMU data are processed and passes all QC checks, the data are combined with the laser range data. This processing step is performed in the LiDAR manufacturer’s developed software. Calibration is done at this stage of the processing. Although the methods of performing calibration are software-dependent (and hence manufacturer-dependent), the LiDAR vendor should test the calibrated data independently. This is usually done by interrogating data from four overlapping flight lines flown in opposite and perpendicular directions along building rooftops and flat surfaces such as airport runways.
Any misalignment between the IMU and the LiDAR scanner can be determined using this approach. This information can be fed back into the calibration software to improve the overall calibration of the data. Calibration testing is recommended prior to each mission and is necessary when any of the LiDAR system components are remounted on the aircraft. Several different types of airborne LiDAR systems were developed in the research and scientific field since the late 1970s through the 1980s. These systems typically involved the use of laser profilers to generate a single line profile of the ground beneath an aircraft. The development of Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) technologies in the 1990s for civilian applications eventually led to the use of airborne LiDAR systems for accurate topographic mapping. The development of laser scanners (explained in Section 1-1.b above) during the same decade also enabled the use of these systems for wide-area topographic mapping. Airborne LiDAR systems can be broadly classified based on the following specifications: (1) Laser wavelength (2) Pulse energy, pulse width, and beam divergence; (3) Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF); (4) Operating Altitude; and (5) Return type.

c.	Operational Considerations

(1)	Reflectance. Reflectance is an important property that affects LiDAR performance. The amount of energy that arrives back at the LIDAR receiver is directly proportional to the percentage of energy that reflects off the object, or in other words the object’s reflectance. The reflectance of the object is wavelength-dependent, and because LiDAR systems are monochromatic, the reflectance at that particular wavelength determines how detectable an object is given the laser power. Figure 1-6 shows the relative spectral reflectance of various common landscape materials.

(2)	Operating Altitude. The operating altitude for an airborne LiDAR system is largely dependent on the required point density of data and the ability of the laser to reliably detect returned energy and determine the elevation of a target at varying reflectivities. Some LiDAR
 


 
systems are specifically designed as low-altitude sensors with relatively low pulse energy. These systems have typically high PRFs that enable the acquisition of 20-50 points per square meter at operating altitude of 500-3000 ft.
Other systems are designed to be used at much higher operating altitudes (3000-8000 ft). These systems are designed for wide-area mapping with swath widths that can extend to 1500 meters. Until early 2006, high-altitude sensors were limited by the inability to track multiple pulses in air (MPiA). For these sensors without MPiA capability, an emitted laser pulse had to bounce off the target and be received by
 



 
the sensor before the next pulse could be emitted. As a result, the PRF and operating altitude had to be limited in order to have only 1 pulse in the air at any instant of time. Recent developments in firmware now allow the tracking of MPiA, also known as Multiple Time Around (MTA), and some sensors can track up to 8 pulses in the air. MPiA technology has enabled LiDAR sensors to use 2 laser sources simultaneously (dual-channel lasers), thereby producing 800 KHz PRF and the ability to operate at altitudes of over 7000 ft.

(3)	Return Type. Early versions of airborne LiDAR systems were capable of recording only one pulse at low pulse repetition rates. However, more advanced LiDAR systems can record simultaneously multiple returns for each transmitted pulse, and the reflected intensity for each return. Multiple return LiDAR systems are very useful in forestry applications or even to derive bare Earth topography under vegetation. When the laser beam from a multi-return system interacts with a tree canopy, then the first return is usually assumed to arrive from the top of the tree (or where the transmitted laser beam first interacts with the tree canopy). The last return may interact with the ground underneath the tree, although the ability to map the ground is largely dependent on the density of the vegetated canopy. Intermediate returns, perhaps 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, are expected to be caused by tree branches and understory vegetation between the top of the canopy and the ground.

1-2. Project Specifications. Numerous sensor parameters affect the desired quality and specifications of the LiDAR data. The USGS LiDAR Base Specification Version 1.2, at Appendix F, provides three of the most common LiDAR Quality Level (QL) specifications
 



relevant to industry QL1 LiDAR (with 1-foot contour accuracy and 8 points/m2), and QL2 LiDAR (also with 1-foot contour accuracy but with 2 points/m2) both ensure that the point cloud and derived data products are suitable for the inter-Agency National 3D Elevation Program (3DEP); whereas QL3 LiDAR (with 2-foot contour accuracy and 0.5 point/m2) ensures that the bare-earth DEMs derived from LiDAR data are suitable for ingestion into the National Elevation Dataset (NED). Using the USGS Lidar Base Specification at any of these three Quality Levels will ensure that it is consistent with the goals of the National Digital Elevation Program (NDEP). Also see the ASPRS Positional Accuracy Standards for Digital Geospatial Data, at Appendix D, from which the Elevation Data Vertical Accuracy Standards were extracted in Chapter 3, Table 3-6. LiDAR point density and vertical accuracy are the two main cost drivers of an airborne LiDAR survey. LiDAR data can be collected with a wide variety of point densities depending on the needs of the project. The selection of point density is a big driver of the overall cost of a LiDAR project and should be selected with consideration to the end uses for the LiDAR. A LiDAR product with 1 point per square meter (ppsm) is sufficient for many applications such as flood mapping in many areas. Higher point densities (4-8 ppsm) allow for greater utilization of the data for mapping planimetric features such as roads and structures as well as for vegetation analysis such as biomass and canopy studies. Additionally, specialized LiDAR at very high densities > 20 ppsm are often used for mapping infrastructure in greater detail such as power lines, pipelines, and for significant features such as mile posts and signs.
The ground conditions should be considered when selecting a point density as well. If the area is covered with dense vegetations such as a coniferous forest a higher density and more overlap would be required to penetrate to the ground than an area where leaf-off conditions exist.

6-Project Planning. There are numerous requirements to assess when planning a LiDAR project as shown in the specifications section of this chapter. However, regardless of the specific requirements project planning always starts with the basic questions: Why is this dataset needed? What are the specific deliverables that are needed? When are the deliverables needed?

a.	Review of Project Specifications. Planning is performed after careful review of the project specifications and answering a series of questions: Should maps be compiled to NAD83 (HARN) for the horizontal datum and NAVD88 for the vertical datum? Should elevation data (orthometric heights) be produced by converting from ellipsoid heights using the GEOID12A model? Should the coordinate reference system use the relevant State Plane Coordinate System or Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates? (Note: State Plane coordinates are more accurate for typical requirements). Should the units be feet or meters? If feet, should U.S. Survey Feet or International Feet be used? What should be the nominal point density? What classifications should be included i.e., ground, water, buildings, vegetation, etc? Are planimetric features such as roads or buildings needed to be extracted from the LiDAR data? Are there limits on environmental factors such as shadows, clouds, topography, climate, snow
 


cover, standing water, tidal and river levels? Will DEMs, DSM, Contours, or other derivative products be produced? What are the metadata requirements? How are accuracies to be reported in the metadata; will the accuracy be reported using the accuracy at the 95% confidence level for the NVA? Are waveform data needed? If yes, what is the data format?

(1)	LiDAR Point Density. LiDAR data can be collected with a wide variety of point densities depending on the needs of the project. The selection of point density is a big driver of the overall cost of a LiDAR project and should be selected with consideration to the end uses for the LiDAR. Modern LiDAR sensors are capable of acquiring LiDAR data with a higher density than previously available and can do so at higher altitudes and with less overlap. A LiDAR product with 1 point per square meter (ppsm) is sufficient for many applications such as flood mapping in many areas. Higher point densities (4-8 ppsm) allow for greater utilization of the data for mapping planimetric features such as roads and structures as well as for vegetation analysis such as biomass and canopy studies. Additionally, specialized LiDAR at very high densities > 20 ppsm are often used for mapping infrastructure in greater detail such as power lines, pipelines, and for Department of Transportation (DOT) significant features such as mile posts and signs. The ground conditions should be considered when selecting a point density as well. If the area is covered with dense vegetations such as a coniferous forest a higher density and more overlap would be required to penetrate to the ground than an area where leaf-off conditions exist.

(2)	Swath Overlap. Planning for swath overlap should also be included in the overall planning of the point density. A higher percentage of overlap may be beneficial in an area with dense vegetation as there will be more look angles from the sensor to the ground at any given points. The result would mean that there could be a lower point density requirement in an individual swath with the overlap accounting for an overall higher point density on the project. Depending on the scanning pattern, data from the extreme edges of the swath may be unusable due to geometric nature of the scan pattern. Typically, 10% overlap between swaths is the minimum requirement for an airborne LIDAR collect. However, most LiDAR flights are conducted with 30% overlap, and those that require higher pulse density in vegetated areas are often flown with 55% overlap.

b.	Flight Planning. Flight planning is always the responsibility of the acquisition contractor. Flight planning for LiDAR will vary greatly depending on the sensor utilized for the acquisition. Parameters such as flying height, ground speed, scan rate, scan angle, etc will be different for each sensor. The contractor’s flight plan should be evaluated to ensure there is sufficient swath overlap given the sensor’s scanning mechanism and project accuracy specifications. Typically, 10% overlap between swaths is the minimum requirement for an airborne LIDAR collect. However, most LiDAR flights are conducted with 30% overlap, and those that require higher pulse density in vegetated areas are often flown with 55% overlap. A higher percentage of overlap may be beneficial in an area with dense vegetation as there will be more look angles from the sensor to the ground at any given points. The result would be a lower point density
 



requirement in an individual swath with the overlap accounting for an overall higher point density on the project. Depending on the scanning pattern, data from the extreme edges of the swath may be unusable due to geometric nature of the scan pattern. Table 1-1 below shows the operational parameters for a sample LiDAR project for an Optech ALTM 3100 system. The LiDAR flight planning process is mostly automated after entering basic information such as point density, overlap requirements, and scan angles. Trajectories are planned for each flight line. Furthermore, modern Flight Management Systems (FMS) enable the pilot to fly these trajectories with close tolerance. LiDAR sensors are actively acquiring data throughout the entire flight which requires the aircraft to be consistently ‘on-line’ to ensure full coverage.
Additionally, sensor operators are often able to view the acquisition in real time and assess areas where voids or sensor anomalies may be present during the flight. While LiDAR sensors also have some forms of stabilization, the roll, pitch and yaw of the aircraft still depends upon wind conditions. Regardless of sensor to be used, flight planning also includes the assessment of military and other controlled air space where special permits may be required. Aviation Sectional Charts are often used to determine flight restrictions and controlled airspace when planning flight lines.


heights as the different sensors each have variable requirements for flying height in order to meet project specifications. The principal flight planning parameters then are the point density and overlap required for the project. With LiDAR sensors, storage is handled via ruggedized mass storage usually in the form of removable hard disk drives or flash drives depending on the sensor in use. Figure 1-7 shows a flight diagram with planned flight lines and cross flight lines that are used for calibration.

c.	Aircraft considerations. Twin engine aircraft are used most often for airborne LiDAR remote sensing. Twin engine aircraft provide efficient operations for sensors up to 20,000 feet above sea level; they are equipped with power sources to handle a suite of modern sensors; they offer workspace and comfort to the pilot and camera operator; and the twin engines provide additional safety in the event a single engine should stall. Maintenance, operation, ferry and collection costs can be quite variable among different twin engine aircraft. For altitudes above 20,000 feet, performance (cost) is improved when using turboprop or jet aircraft instead of piston aircraft.

d.	Survey Control. Three forms of mapping control support airborne LiDAR mapping: airborne GPS control, ground control, and quality control checkpoints. Contract specifications should reference the following standards and guidelines: FGDC-STD-007.4-2002, Geospatial Positioning Accuracy Standards PART 4: Standards for Architecture, Engineering, Construction (A/E/C) and Facility Management, as well as CHAPTER 3 of this manual, Applications and Accuracy Standards, specifically Table 3-6, Elevation Data Vertical Accuracy Standards. Other
 



references relevant to mapping control include EM 1110-1-1002, Survey Markers and Monumentation; EM 1110-1-1003, Navstar Global Positioning System Surveying; and NOAA Technical Memorandum NOS NGS-58, Guidelines for Establishing GPS-Derived Ellipsoid Heights (Standards: 2 cm and 5 cm), version 4.3.

(1)	Airborne GPS Control. Airborne LiDAR is acquired with the use of ABGPS for recording the 3D (X/Y/Z) coordinates of each pulse, plus an inertial measurement unit (IMU) for recording the roll, pitch and yaw of the sensor, when each pulse is transmitted and received (see Figure 1-8). When six exterior orientation parameters of each pulse (X/Y/Z and roll/pitch/yaw) are known, requirements for surveyed ground control are greatly reduced. ABGPS receivers must be capable of tracking both coarse acquisition (C/A) and pseudorange (P-code) data. They must provide dual frequency (L1 and L2) and multi-channel capability with on-the-fly ambiguity resolution and be able to log GPS data at 1-second epochs or better. GLONASS receivers capable of receiving satellite information from GPS and GLONASS constellation are preferred over GPS-only receivers.

(2)	Ground Control. These are the well-established points that GPS ground base stations will be placed on to facilitate accurate positioning of the aircraft In the U.S., this typically involves the use of a Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) or the identification and recovery of well-documented permanent control monuments or benchmarks from the National Geodetic Survey’s National Spatial Reference System (NSRS)  (go to http://www.ngs.noaa.gov, then click on Survey Mark Datasheets and/or CORS). If a control network of horizontal control monuments and/or vertical control benchmarks does not exist, a control network will first need to be established per references cited above. Figure 1-9 shows an example NGS Data Sheet with the red arrow point at the horizontal and vertical network accuracy at the 95% confidence level. In addition to data shown here, Data Sheets typically also include additional information such as: State Plane and UTM coordinates; U.S. National Grid spatial address; explanations of how horizontal coordinates, ellipsoid heights and orthometric heights were determined; station description and instructions for finding the monument; station recovery history, etc.
(3)	Quality Control Check Points. The quality control checkpoints are typically collected by a survey team independent of the LiDAR vendor so that these checkpoints remain “blind” during the LiDAR acquisition and calibration processing. This can be another contracted party or district personnel. The ASPRS Positional Accuracy Standards for Digital Geospatial Data, at Appendix C, provides detailed guidelines on the number and location of check points. Google Earth or other open source imagery can be used for point selection unless alternative orthophotography is available.
(4)	Check Point Distribution. When possible, dispersed surveys (Figure 1-10), which provide a more legitimate assessment of data accuracy throughout the project area for different flight lines, are recommended. For dispersed surveys, no two survey checkpoints should be closer than 5,000 feet from the next closest point. If cost and accessibility are an issue, then cluster surveys can be performed (Figure 1-11). Cluster surveys are typically five points when five land cover categories are being tested, one per category, with a minimum spacing of about 1000 feet between points. Clusters should be dispersed following the ASPRS guideline that at least 20% of the points must be in each quadrant. These types of surveys work best with real-time kinematic (RTK) surveys where a base station can be established and five points (all at least 1000 feet apart from each other) can be surveyed. RTK is also ideal for establishing inter-visible pairs for conventional surveys to establish forest points. Please note inter-visible pairs cannot “count” as check points as they typically do not conform to the minimum distance rule. Furthermore, no two checkpoints in a single cluster should be for the same land cover class, and it is often difficult to identify all five land cover classes within the area of a single cluster.

(5)	Check Point Location. In addition to land cover classes, location and distribution, the surveyor also needs to avoid known pitfalls in selection of checkpoint locations. It is important for the surveyor to understand that the horizontal coordinates of QA/QC checkpoints do not normally match the horizontal coordinates of individual LiDAR pulses. Instead, LiDAR

elevations are interpolated from surrounding points to determine the most probable elevation of the LiDAR data at the horizontal coordinates of each QA/QC checkpoint. Interpolation assumptions are reasonably valid only when the following guidelines are followed with checkpoint selection:

(a)	Each checkpoint should be on terrain that is flat or uniformly sloping within 5 meters in all directions from the checkpoint coordinates. Interpolation procedures can fail if the terrain undulates up and down surrounding the checkpoint, or if the slope is curved (concave or convex). Steep slopes should also be avoided for location of checkpoints.

(b)	There should be no breakline within 5 meters of a checkpoint. Breaklines define the edge between two intersecting surfaces with different slopes. This rule can best be explained by using a breakline on a bridge abutment as an example of where checkpoints should not be located. Interpolation of LiDAR elevations around a bridge abutment would normally include a point on top of the bridge deck and another point over the side of the bridge, perhaps near water level 10 feet lower; interpolating between these two elevations (even if both LiDAR elevations were perfect) would erroneously show that the LiDAR data had an elevation error of 5 feet.

(c)	Similarly, checkpoints, even on flat terrain, should avoid logs, tree stumps, rock piles, or other elevated features that could be mapped by LiDAR pulses within 5 meter of a QA/QC checkpoint.

(d)	For survey of checkpoints to be used for horizontal accuracy assessments, surveyors should avoid selecting checkpoints with a high probability of being obscured when mapped with LiDAR (or imagery). Because clearly defined point features are required, horizontal checkpoints are commonly surveyed on corners of paint stripes on asphalt. Such points should not be located under trees (in parking lots) for example, because the black/white intensity variations will not be visible. Similarly, such points should not be selected in actual parking spaces where vehicles are liable to be parked at the time the LiDAR data are acquired.

(e)	For these reasons, in spite of check point pre-selection, final checkpoint locations cannot be determined in the office but must be left up to the field surveyor. Flexibility must be given to the surveyor as field conditions, including accessibility, are unknown. The surveyor must use the guidance above to plan where checkpoints are likely to be located, but then must make the final decisions in the field, ensuring points are well spaced, have the correct number of land cover categories, and avoid the pitfalls identified above.
 



6-LiDAR Data Processing and Deliverable Development. The range data from the LiDAR sensor are integrated with the aircraft georeferencing (GPS) and orientation (IMU) data to produce a processed laser file, yielding the 3D position and intensity for each laser return. The following sections outline the general steps that are used to process the LiDAR data into some common final deliverables.
a.	Data Formatting. After LiDAR acquisition and calibration, LiDAR data are typically processed in order to deliver bare earth classified, LAS files in version 1.2 (formatted to Point Record Format 1) adhering to a specific tiling schema (e.g. US National Tiling Grid) at a specified interval (usually 1,000 m x 1,000 m). Tiles which are fully within the project boundary contain data to the full extent of each tile. Tiles which lie on the project boundary are not filled to the full extent of the tile, unless specified in the scope of work. No over edge data are required but gaps in the data at the project boundary are considered unacceptable. Each LiDAR LAS file (per tile) produced should contain the following elements, as a minimum, for each return:

(1)	The return number for each signal
(2)	Horizontal and Vertical Position (x,y,z) in the specified horizontal and vertical datum
(3)	Intensity return values for each return signal
(4)	GPS Timestamp of capture for each point (the timestamp should be unique for each laser pulse)
(5)	Georeference information included in the LAS header
b.	LiDAR Data Classification. Classification is the process whereby the acquired LiDAR points are filtered, and those representing ground and above ground features (such as trees and buildings) are assigned to separate classes. LiDAR data can be classified into various categories including ground, vegetation, water body, and buildings. Typically, each LAS file is classified as bare-ground or not bare-ground according to the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) LAS format classification table (at a minimum):

(1)	Class 1 – Unclassified (non-ground)

(2)	Class 2 – Bare-earth Ground

(3)	Class 7 – Noise (low, high or manually identified)
(4)	Class 9 – Water (shots from water surface of oceans, lakes, rivers, or streams derived from the breaklines generated from the intensity images)
 


(5)	Class 12 – Overlap

An automated filtering process is first applied where various classes of points are separated. General parameters are set for terrain type (i.e. flat, rolling, hilly) and terrain cover (i.e. open/ non-vegetated, light vegetation, medium vegetation, heavy vegetation), along with other parameters that help fine-tune the automated classification. Vegetation and any other structures are initially separated using an automated process. While the automated classification process often classifies 80% or more of the undesirable above ground features, it also erroneously classifies objects such as natural terrain (hills, rock cuts), or man-made features that should be moved out of the ground Class 2. Therefore, a manual analysis using independent checks is performed to produce the final LiDAR point files. Supplementing automated terrain filtering, LiDAR technicians perform interactive processing to achieve reliable bare earth conditions. The resulting elevation accurately depicts the bare earth surface (Class 2). Class 12 (overlap) is used to classify overlap points that are not used in any other classes. These points are typically along the edge of the scan and are deemed to be unreliable or having poor accuracy and hence not to be
used in the ground model. Breakline data are utilized to perform LiDAR classification for class 9 – water (see Section 6.4e). The manual classification is the most time-consuming and often the most expensive component of LiDAR processing. If application of the LiDAR data requires only bare-earth data, there is no need to request for additional classification of buildings, bridges, vegetation, etc. These data will be available in the “Unclassified” class (Class 1) and can be classified in the future if the need for these additional classes arises.

c.	LiDAR Data Quality. QA/QC procedures are continued through all iterations of the data processing cycle. Data are typically passed through an automated set of macros for initial cleaning, a first edit by a trained technician, and a second review and edit by an advanced processor, and finally exported to a final product. All final products are reviewed for completeness and correctness before delivery. The goal of LiDAR processing is to achieve the following minimum requirements (or as laid out in the Scope of Work):
(1)	LiDAR data from different flight lines will be consistent across flight lines with a maximum 7-10 cm vertical offset between adjacent flight lines. This is referred to as the relative accuracy.


(2)	No data voids due to system malfunctions or lack of overlap.

(3)	Dense vegetation data voids minimized by automatic removal process.

(4)	The lineage (metadata), positional, content (completeness), attribution, and logical consistency accuracies of all digital elevation data produced will conform to the specifications.
(5)	Product Accuracy Information Reporting: Product accuracy information will be reported according to NSSDA guidelines. At a minimum, statements concerning source materials and
 



production processes used will be provided in the metadata sufficient to meet the requirement of the ASPRS Elevation Data Vertical Accuracy Standards (see Chapter 3).

(6)	LiDAR data will be classified correctly with limited artifacts or misclassifications remaining in the dataset.

(7)	All LiDAR processing and editing will be consistent.
(8)	Statistics run on 100% of the data will verify file formatting, projection information, classes used, scan angles, returns per pulse, and nominal point density.
d.	LiDAR Data Accuracy. LiDAR data are typically compiled to meet a Horizontal Accuracy of 1 meter RMSE. Bare earth topographic LiDAR data are tested to satisfy Non- vegetated Vertical Accuracy (NVA) and Vegetated Vertical Accuracy (VVA), depending on the Quality Level (QL) chosen. Table 1-2 provides these values as a function of the QL selected when using the USGS Lidar Base Specification Version 1.2 (see Appendix F). VVA will be tested using the 95th percentile for all vegetated land cover categories. LiDAR data are usually tested against a TIN created from the final bare-earth points. Vertical accuracy testing is performed against a TIN as it is unlikely a discrete LiDAR point will be located at the same X/Y location as the survey checkpoints. Note that the NVA and VVA accuracy statistics are affected by bare earth processing, and not necessarily the system calibration.
e.	Breaklines. Breaklines assist in the development of hydro-flattened DEMs, if they are required for a project. LiDAR intensity images in combination with the elevation data can be used to create a pseudo stereo pair which then allows a photogrammetric system operator to “see” in 3D and use this technique to better determine the location of ground features. This technique is often defined as lidargrammetry, and is used extensively in the creation of breaklines. The first step is to create synthetic LiDAR stereo-pairs using a software such as the GeoCue LiDAR Pak software. These synthetic LiDAR stereo pairs can then be stereoscopically compiled to create breakline features. SOCET for ArcGIS is often used for this compilation. SOCET for ArcGIS embeds the photogrammetrically-compiled features into an ESRI 10.x geodatabase. This ultimately means there is no CAD to GIS file translation required and that the resultant photo interpreted data is topologically correct and GIS ready upon completion.
Although this requirement is project specific, breaklines are commonly collected for the following features:

(1)	Streams and Rivers. The banks or land/water interface shall be depicted for all linear hydrographic features of a certain width and length (e.g. at least 50 feet in width and ½ mile in length). Islands greater than a certain size (e.g. ½ acre) will be excluded as “holes” in the Streams and Rivers features. Each vertex placed needs to maintain vertical integrity, including monotonicity and connectivity. Exemptions to monotonicity may occur due to complex branch networks. All elevations are at or slightly below the surrounding terrain.

(2)	Ponds and Lakes. The land/water interface is depicted for all water bodies, such as lakes, ponds, and reservoirs, at a constant elevation that are usually 1 acre in size or greater. Every vertex on each feature must be placed at the same elevation and all elevation is set at or slightly below the surrounding terrain. Islands greater than ½ acre in size are usually excluded as “holes” in the Ponds and Lakes features.

f.	Hydro Flattened DEM Production. The processed and classified LiDAR point cloud may be used to create Digital Elevation Models. For most applications, bare-earth DEMs with 1-meter pixel resolution are created for the project area. These DEMs may be hydro-flattened, using the breaklines collected as described above. The DEMs are tiled according to the project tile grid and are in ESRI GRID format.

g.	FGDC Metadata. Project level metadata for each deliverable product must be created. Metadata must be delivered that fully comply with FGDC metadata format standard in eXtensible Markup Language (XML) format. Metadata must contain the following information:


(1)	Collection Report detailing mission planning and flight logs

(2)	Survey Report detailing the collection of ground control and reference points used for both data calibration and QA/QC accuracy assessments.

(3)	Processing Report detailing LiDAR calibration, LiDAR classification, and product generation procedures including methodology used for breakline collection and hydro-flattening.

(4)	QA/QC Reports detailing the analysis, accuracy assessment and validation of the point data (absolute, within swath, and between swath); the bare-earth surface (absolute); and other optional deliverables as appropriate

(5)	Control and Calibration points: All control and reference points used to calibrate, control, process and validate the LiDAR point data or any derivative products will be delivered.
(6)	Geo-referenced, digital spatial representation of the precise extents of each delivered dataset. This should reflect the extents of the actual LiDAR source or derived product data, exclusive of Triangular Irregular Network (TIN) artifacts or raster NODATA areas. A union of tile boundaries or minimum bounding rectangle is not acceptable. ESRI Polygon shapefile is usually preferred.

(7)	All metadata files must contain sufficient content to fully detail all procedures used for data processing, QAQC, and finalization.
h.	Deliverables. Although users are mostly interested in the final bare-earth DEM from a LiDAR data set, it is important to define a list of deliverables that the vendor will provide from the onset of the survey. A kickoff meeting should be held prior to data acquisition to ensure that all project requirements and schedule are understood. Project partners should be invited to the kickoff meeting. Any concerns from the vendor or the project partners should be discussed during this meeting. Minutes from the meeting should be the first delivery of any LiDAR project. Following mobilization, the vendor must submit daily acquisition and field condition reports that provide an overview of the environment conditions during the time of survey. These reports are usually delivered via email during acquisition, but should be included as a summary in the acquisition report. Following acquisition and upon demobilization, the vendor should prepare an acquisition and calibration report that contains details on the acquisition, tidal considerations (if any), control points used, preliminary vertical accuracy assessment, and all GPS/IMU processing reports for each mission. Figure 1-12 shows a Table of Contents for a sample acquisition report.
A LiDAR project report must be delivered at the end of the processing along with the final delivered products. The project report serves as the master report for the entire project and includes detailed explanation on the processing and qualitative assessment performed on the data. The quantitative analysis and the accuracy results (NVA and VVA) must be clearly demonstrated and information on all survey points used for the accuracy analysis must be included. Breakline production procedures should be well defined including the production methodology, qualitative assessment and topology rules used for the project. A data dictionary defining the horizontal and vertical datum, coordinate system and projection used for this project and all breakline feature definitions for streams and rivers, and inland lakes and ponds should be clearly defined. The DEM production methodology and QA/QC assessment on the DEMs must be clearly explained. Often, the LiDAR acquisition report is included in this final project report so that one document provides the complete information on the entire life cycle of the project. Figure 1-13 illustrates a Table of Contents of a sample project report.


The list of deliverables must also include the LiDAR data and derivative products as required by the statement of work. Given the very large volume of data, these deliverables are typically requested on external hard drives. The following list of deliverables is usually requested during final delivery:
(1)	One set of classified LAS files in accordance with the tiling schema noted in the statement of work.

(2)	One set of raster DEM’s (hydro flattened bare earth) delivered in the specified grid format (for e.g., GeoTIFF or ESRI Raster Grid). The DEM’s must also be delivered in the project tiling and required naming schema.

(3)	One set of 1-meter intensity imagery in GeoTIFF file format.
(4)	One set of FGDC Metadata for each data deliverable.
(5)	One ESRI file geodatabase containing the breakline data, if specified.
(6)	Project report
Recently, there is an increase interest in positioning techniques based on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as Global Positioning System (GPS), cellular network infrastructure or on the integration of the two technologies for a wide spread of applications such as Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL), tracking systems, navigation, Pedestrian Navigation Systems (PNSs), intelligent transportation Systems, precise positioning and emergency callers. During the last 15 years there are many important events in the field of satellite navigation systems such as: (a)the full operational GPS in 1993, when 24 GPS satellites were operating in their assigned orbits, available for navigation use and providing Standard Positioning Services
(SPS), (b) the new European satellite system Galileo, (c) the modernized of US satellite system GPS, and (d) the reconstruction of Russian satellite system Glonass.
The increasing demand for commercial location-based services (LBS) has driven cellular-phone and network manufacturers to focus on positioning solutions, which are even more accurate than the regulatory mandates for positioning of emergency callers and other user services and applications. LBS projects aim to improve user-friendly info-mobility services for position determination by combining wireless communications, satellite navigation (GNSS) and geographic information systems (GIS), based on a mobile client/server architecture (Lohnert et al., 2001).
The meaning of GNSS is the technical interoperability and compatibility between various satellite navigation systems such as modernized GPS, Galileo, reconstructed GLONASS to be used by civilian users without considering the nationalities of each system in order to promote the safety and convenience of life (GALILEO, 2003; Feng, 2003).

Our interest here is to outline the new technologies and applications evolved and appeared from the integration between the GNSS, GIS and wireless communications.
We will give an introduction of GNSS by introducing the characteristic of the three satellite systems (GPS, GLONASS and Galileo), signal structure, receiver design, math model of single point positioning and differential positioning, Wide area differential positioning such as WAAS, EGNOS, and MSAS, GNSS and wireless applications such as RTK network and LBS including AVL and other services will be reviewed.

Key Words: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Global Positioning System (GPS), GLONASS, Geographic Information System (GIS), GALILEO, LBS, AVL, Wireless Networks, WAAS, EGNOS, Applications of GNSS/GIS to city planning and engineering.

1.	INTRODUCTION

Satellite navigation systems has become integral part of all applications where mobility plays a important role (Heinrichs et al., 2005). These functions will be at the heart of the mobile phone third-generation (3G) networks such as the UMTS. In transportation systems, the presence of
receivers will become as common as seat belts or airbags, with all car manufacturers equipping their entry-level vehicles with these devices.
As for the past developments, GPS launched a variety of techniques, products and, consequently, applications and services. The milestone of satellite navigation is the real time positioning and time synchronization. For that reason the implementation of wide-area augmentation systems should be highlighted, because they allow a significant improvement of accuracy and integrity performance. WAAS, EGNOS and MSAS provide over US, Europe, Japan a useful augmentation to GPS, GLONASS and Galileo services (Mulassano, et al., 2004).
GNSS development has an interesting aspect due to its sensitive nature. Considerable events or developments are always subject to a couple of differentiators: technological developments and political decisions.
GPS and Glonass in all stages of improvements are strictly related to those differentiators. The approval and startup of the European Galileo program is considered by far the most real innovation. Technological and political decisions in Galileo substantiate that interoperability and compatibility must be reached in the forthcoming years. Such issues are the true GNSS improvement for the benefit of institutions and organizations.
GNSS applications in all fields will play a key role, moving its use from the transportation domain to multimodal use, outdoors and indoors. It is expected that GNSS will increase significantly the precision in position domain (Lachapelle et al., 2002).

The concept of reference system for navigation is essential since all the applications of GNSS are related to the coordinate system used. The main application of GNSS is focused on the potential of to determine the position in the Global reference system any where any time on the Globe in a simple, fast and cost-effective manner.
The integration between GNSS and other related technologies such as telecommunications (GSM, GPRS, UMTS), the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS), has created numerous applications that needs more time to be discussed in details. Many research efforts have been exerted in order to find each new applications to promote the quality of our life using the GNSS benefits (Lohnert et al., 2001; Al-Bayari and Sadoun, 2005).
2.	GNSS COMPONENTS

The GNSS consist of three main satellite technologies: GPS, Glonass and Galileo. Each of them consists mainly of three segments: (a) space segment, (b) control segment and (c) user segment. These segments are almost similar in the three satellite technologies, which are all together make up the GNSS. As of today, the complete satellite technology is the GPS technology and most of the existing worldwide applications related to the GPS technology. The GNSS technology will become clearer after the operation of Galileo and the reconstruction of Glonass in the next few years.

2.1	Global Positioning System:
The United States Department of Defense (DoD) has developed the Navstar GPS, which is an all-weather, space based navigation system to meet the needs of the USA military forces and accurately determine their position, velocity, and time in a common reference system, any where on or near the Earth on a continuous basis (Wooden, 1985).
GPS has made a considerable impact on almost all positioning, navigation, timing and monitoring applications. It provides particularly coded satellite signals that can be processed in a GPS receiver, allowing the receiver to estimate position, velocity and time (Hofmann-Wellenhof et al., 2001). There are four GPS satellite signals that are used to compute positions in three dimensions and the time offset in the receiver clock. GPS comprises three main components:
-	Space segment: The Space Segment of the system consists of the GPS satellites; see Figure
1. These space vehicles (SVs) send radio signals from space as shown in Figure 2.
-	Control segment: The Control Segment consists of a system of tracking stations located around the world. The Master Control facility is located at Schriever Air Force Base (formerly Falcon AFB) in the State of Colorado, USA.
-	User segment: The GPS User Segment consists of the GPS receivers and the user community. GPS receivers convert space vehicle (SV) signals into position, velocity, and time estimates.
 

The satellites are dispersed in six orbital planes on almost circular orbits with an altitude of about 20,200 km above the surface of the Earth, inclined by 55 degree with respect to the equator and with orbital periods of approximately 11 hours 58 minutes (half a sidereal day).
The categories are Block I, Block II, Block IIR (R for replenishment) and Block IIA (A for advanced) and a further follow-on category Block IIF has also been planned (ICD-GPS, 2003). Figure 3 shows the main GPS segments.
2.1.1	GPS Signals
The generated signals on board the satellites are based or derived from generation of a fundamental frequency o=10.23 MHZ (Hofmann-Wellenhof et al., 2001). The signal is
 
controlled by atomic clock and has stability in the range of 1013
 
over one day. Two carrier
 
signals in the L-band, denoted L1 and L2, are generated by integer multiplications of o. The carriers L1 and L2 are biphase modulated by codes to provide satellite clock readings to the receiver and transmit information such as the orbital parameters. The codes consist of a sequence with the states +1 or -1, corresponding to the binary values 0 or 1. The biphase modulation is performed by a 180° shift in the carrier phase whenever a change in the code state occurs; see Figure 4. The clear/access code (C/A-code) and precision code (P-code) are used for the satellite clock reading, both are characterized by a pseudorandom noise (PRN) sequence. The W-code is employed to encrypt the P-code to the Y-code when Anti Spoofing (A-S) is applied. The navigation message is modulated using the two carriers (L1 and L2) at a chipping rate of 50 bps.
It contains information on the satellite orbits, orbit perturbations, GPS time, satellite clock, ionospheric parameters, and system status messages (Leick, 2003). The modulation of L1 by P- code, C/A-code and navigation message (D), is done using the quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) scheme. The C/A-code is placed on the LI carrier with 90° offset from the P-code since they have the same bit transition epochs. For the L1 and L2 we have:
 
L1(t)  a1 P(t)W (t) cos(2f1t)  a1C / A(t)D(t) sin(2f1t)
L2(t)  a2 P(t)W (t) cos(2f 2 t)

The signal broadcast by the satellite is a spread spectrum signal, which makes it less prone to jamming. The basic concept of spread spectrum technique is that the information waveform with small bandwidth is converted by modulating it with a large-bandwidth waveform (Hofmann- Wellenhof et al., 2001).
The generation of pseudo random sequence (PRN) in the code is based on the use of an electronic hardware device called tapped feed back shift register (FBSR). This device can generate a large variety of pseudo random codes, but in this way the generated code repeat it self after some very long time. The receiver could distinguish the signals coming from different satellites because the receiving C/A code (the Gold code), has low cross-correlation and is unique for each satellite (Leick, 2003).
The navigation message consists of 25 frames with each frame containing 1500 bit and each frame is subdivided into 5 sub-frames with 300 bit. The information transmitted by the navigation message is periodically updated by the control segment.

2.2	Modernized GPS
Due to the vast civil applications of GPS technology during the past decade or so and due to the new technologies used in the satellite and receivers, the U.S government has decided to extend the capabilities of GPS to give more benefits to the civil community. In addition to the existing GPS signals, new signals will be transmitted by GPS satellite; see Figure 5. Moreover, this will increase the robustness in the signals and improve the resistance to signal interference. This definitely will lead to a better quality of service (QoS). The new signals added to the GPS (Fontana et al., 2001), are: (i) a new L5 frequency in an aeronautical radio navigation service (ARNS) band with a signal structure designed to improve aviation applications, (ii) C/A code to L2C carrier (L2 civil signal ), and (iii) a new military (M) code on L1 and L2 frequency for the DoD has been added. It has the potential to track signal even in poor conditions where the C/A code tracking on L1 would not be possible. The new military code will be transmitted from the Block IIR-M and IIF satellites (Betz, 2002).
 
It is well known that the presence of dual frequency measurements (L1 and L2) has good advantages to eliminate the effect of the ionosphere and enhance the ambiguity resolution especially for the high precision measurements (Liu and Lachapelle, 2002). High-end civil dual frequency systems will be based on L1 CA-code and the newly designed L2 C-code. In the coming few years the receivers will become more complex in order to allow tracking the new civil code on L2 and tracking the encrypted P on L2 (A-S).

The frequency of L5 is 1176.45MHz, with chipping rate of 10.23 MHz similar to P- code. The high chipping rate of L5 code will provide high performance ranging capabilities and better code measurement than L1 C/A code measurements (Dierendonck and Hegarty, 2000).
L2 has a better correlation protection with respect to L1 since it has a long code. This will be useful in severe conditions where the GPS signals are weak such as navigation in urban, indoor, and forested areas.
The old codes and the new codes (Millitary and civil), on the L1, L2 and L5 need more advanced modulation that better share existing frequency allocations with all signals by increasing spectral separation, and hence conserve the spectrum. Consequently, binary offset carrier (BOC) is used for the Military code modulations (Betz, 2002).


2.3	GLONASS
The GLONASS (GLObal NAvigation Satellite System or “GLObalnaya NAvigatsionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema”) is nearly identical to GPS. Glonass satellite-based radio-navigation
system provides the positioning and timing information to users. It is operated by the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation (GLONASS-ICD, 2002).
Glonass space segment is consist of 24 satellites, equally distributed in 3 orbit separated by 120∘
in the equatorial plane. Satellite orbital altitude is about 19,130 km above the ground surface. This results in an orbital period of 11:15:44 corresponding to 8/17 of a sidereal day.
The future of GLONASS seems uncertain due to economic problems facing the Russian Federation. The number of operational satellites was steadily decreasing over the past few years. The launch of three new GLONASS satellites in December 1998 was the first launch after a lapse of 3 years.
As of January 2006, a total of 10 GLONASS satellites are operational. The oldest of the still active satellites was launched in October, 2000. According to Russian officials the GLONASS system shall again be restored by 2008.

2.3.1	The Signals of the GLONASS Satellites
Glonass transmit C/A-code on L1, P-code on L1 and L2. Glonass observables (code and phase) are similar to GPS. The main difference between GPS and GLONASS is that GLONASS uses Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) technology to discriminate the signals of different satellites, but GPS and Galileo use (Code Division Multiple Access, CDMA) to distinguish between the satellites. All Glonass satellites transmit the same C/A- and P-codes, but each satellite has slightly different carrier frequencies.
The nominal carrier frequencies for the L1and L2 signals may be written as shown below (Leick, 2003): 
1602.5625MHz to 1615.5MHz. Since some of the GLONASS frequencies interfere with frequencies used for radio-astronomy, some changes in the frequency plan are expected after 2005 (GLONASS-ICD, 2002). The navigation message is contained in so-called sub frames,
which have duration of 2.5 minutes. Each sub frame consists of five frames with a duration of 30 seconds. The navigation message contains information, similar to GPS navigation message, about the satellite orbits, their clocks, among others.
On the contrary to GPS, where the broadcast ephemeredes are defined by modified Keplerian elements, the broadcast ephemeredes of GLONASS satellites are defined by positions and velocities referred to an Earth-centered and Earth-fixed systems (PZ-90). The broadcast ephemeredes of the Glonass satellites are updated every 30 minutes.

2.4	GALILEO
GALILEO is Europe’s initiative for a state-of-the-art global navigation satellite system, providing a highly accurate, guaranteed global positioning service under civilian control. Galileo will be not too different from the other GNSS parts (modernized GPs and Glonass (Salgado et al., 2001). It will provide autonomous navigation and positioning services, but at the same time will be interoperable with the two other global satellite navigation systems; the GPS and GLONASS. A user will be able to take a position with the same receiver from any of the satellites in any combination. By providing dual frequencies as standard, however, GALILEO will deliver real-time positioning accuracy down to the meter range. It will guarantee availability of the service under all, but the most extreme circumstances and will inform users within seconds of a failure of any satellite. This will make it appropriate for applications where safety is vital, such as running trains, guiding cars and landing aircraft. The combined use of GALILEO and other GNSS systems can offer much improved performance for all kinds of users worldwide.
GALILEO is expected to be in operation by the year 2008. The first satellite of Galileo system (GIOVE A) has already been lunched in 27th December 2005.

2.4.1	Galileo segments
Galileo segments are almost similar to GPS, but with some modification. The main extension of Galileo compared to GPS is the implementation of a global/ regional segment for integrity monitoring. The objective is to assist the safety critical aircraft navigation and locate and guide railway trains (GALILEO, 2003).
2.4.1.1	Space Segment
The space segment or the constellation features consists of 30 Medium Earth Orbiting (MEO) satellites (27 and 3 active spare satellite), distributed evenly and regularly over three orbit planes. The projected altitude is slightly larger than for GPS 23,616 km and the inclination is 56° (Benedicto and Ludwig, 2002).

2.4.1.2	Ground Segment
The Galileo ground segment is responsible for managing the constellation of navigation satellites, controlling core functions of the navigation mission such as orbit determination of satellites, and clock synchronization, and determining and disseminating (via the MEO satellites) the integrity information, such as the warning alerts within time-to-alarm requirements, at global level. The Global ground segment will also provide interfaces with service centers. The Ground Control Segment will consist of about 12-15 reference stations, 5 up-link stations and two control centers. The ground segment also will include 16-20 monitor stations, three up-link stations for integrity data and two central stations for integrity computations.

2.4.1.3	User Segment:
The user segment consists of different types of user receivers, with different capabilities related to the different GALILEO signals in order to fulfill the various GALILEO services Figure 6.

2.4.2	Galileo signals
The GALILEO frequency should respect the radio-regulations as they are discussed and agreed on at the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) forums such as the World Radio- Communication Conference (WRC). There were different studies that were conducted before the determination of the Galileo signal allocations in order to avoid interference with GPS and Glonass systems, which operate in the same portion of the RF spectrum (Hein et al., 2003).
Galileo will provide several navigation signals in right-hand circular polarization (RHCP) in the frequency ranges of 1164–1215 MHz (E5a and E5b), 1260–1300 MHz (E6) and 1559–1592 MHz (E2-L1-E1) that are part of the Radio Navigation Satellite Service (RNSS) allocation (Hein et al., 2003). All Galileo satellites will share the same nominal frequency, making use of code division multiple access (CDMA) techniques. Galileo will use a different modulation scheme for its signals, the binary offset carrier (BOC) and quadrature phase skip keying (QPSK).
2.4.3	Definition of Services
The Galileo constellation offers the capability of broadcasting globally a set of six signals supporting the open, commercial, safety-of-life and public regulated services (Hein et al., 2003). Each navigation signal is composed of one or two ranging codes and navigation data as well as, depending on the signal, integrity, commercial and search and rescue (SAR) data. Satellite-to- user distance measurements based on ranging codes and data are used in the GALILEO user receivers to fulfill the different GALILEO services (GALILEO, 2003). The main services are:
1.	Open service (OS) data: These are transmitted on the E5a, E5b and E2-L1-E1 carrier frequencies. OS data are available to all users and consist mainly of the navigation and SAR data. Open service offers positioning, navigation and timing signals, which can be accessed free of charge.

2.	Commercial Service (CS), data: These are transmitted on the E5b, E6 and E2-L1-E1 carriers. All CS data are encrypted and provided by service providers that interface with the Galileo Control Centre. Access to those commercial data is provided directly to the users by the service providers. The signal is designed to support very precise local differential applications (Sub-
 
meter accuracy) using the open (option encrypted) signal overlaid with the PRS signal on E6 and also support the integration of GALILEO positioning applications and wireless communications networks.

3.	Safety-of-life Services (SOL) data: These include mainly integrity and Signal in Space Accuracy (SISA) data. Combination of this Galileo services either with the current GPS as augmented by EGNOS corrections, or the future improved GPS and EGNOS integrity-only. Particularly, SOL is based on the satellite navigation signals without using added elements such as WAAS, and EGNOS. The accuracy required is about 4 meter over the Globe. This could be possible by introducing the ionospheric model based on multiple frequency measurements and modeling the other GNSS errors.

4.	Public Regulated Service (PRS) data: These are transmitted on E6 and L1 carrier frequencies. The Public Regulated Service is provided on dedicated frequencies to provide the capability for greater continuity of service placed under EU Governments control for Public applications devoted to European and/or National Security, such as police, civil protection, law enforcement, civil protection such as some emergency services, as well as other governmental activities. The PRS is robust in order to be resistant to interference, jamming and other accidental or malicious aggressions.

3.	GNSS SIGNALS

The overall of mentioned signals (Modernized GPS, Galileo and Glonass signals), make up the GNSS signals. Each satellite system has specific signal characteristics, but each system attempts to be compatible with the others in order to prevent the interferences and attenuation between the signals. It is important to consider that the processing of all signals should be performed using the same receiver, thus a complex receiver design is supposed to be designed and built. As mentioned above, The GNSS frequency plan shall respect the radio-regulations as they are discussed and agreed on at ITU forums. The available spectrum which can be used for the development of Radio-Navigation Satellite Systems (RNSS) is shown in Figure 7.
 
4.	SIGNAL PROCESSING AND RECEIVER DESIGN
The main function of the signal processor in the receiver is the reconstruction of the carriers and extraction of codes and navigation messages. After this stage the receiver performs the Doppler shift measurement by comparing the received signal by a reference signal generated by the receiver. Due to the motion of satellite, the received signal is Doppler shifted.
The code ranges are determined in the delay lock loop (DLL) by using code correlation. The correlation technique provides all components of bimodulated signals. The correlation technique is performed between the generated reference signal and the received one (Hofmann-Wellenhof et al., 2001). The signals are shifted with respect to time so that they are optimally matched based on mathematical correlation.
Currently some geodetic type receivers are available on the market tracking GPS and Glonass satellites simultaneously on both frequencies, in particular the Ashtech Z18 receiver and the TPS (Topcon Positioning Systems) Legacy receivers. The future GNSS receiver could be designed to track the different GNSS signals and could be of many types:
•	The first type could process all GNSS signals GPS L1, L2, L5 and Galileo OS, CS using L1, E5 and E6 and also Glonass L1 and L2.
•	The second type uses free signal and codes, GPS L1 and L2C and Galileo OS, on L1 and E5.
•	The third type uses L1 and E5.
•	Forth type uses GPS L1 and L2 (which are already in the market (Ries et al., 2002).
•	Fifth type uses GPS and Glonass signals (which are already exist), (Leick, 2003).
The most common receiver types are Intermediate Frequency receiver (IF) and the software defined radio receiver (SDR). In the RF front-end receiver the signal is down converted to an intermediate frequency and then sampled, but SDR uses direct digitization, or bandpass sampling. Details on GNSS receiver design could be found in (Schmid et al., 2004; Julien et al., 2004a).
The main components of RF-FE combined GNSS receiver are shown in Figure 8. After sampling and analog to digital conversion (ADC) of the received signal, the receiver performs parallel de- spreading. The received base-band signal is multiplied in parallel with the spreading codes of all visible satellites. The received signal of each satellite is multiplied in parallel with different code delay offsets. These products are then accumulated to compute the cross-correlation function.


Because BOC signals are used in Galileo, supplementary measures are necessary due to the multiple correlation peaks of the auto-correlation function. Carrier tracking is performed using a phase-locked or frequency-locked loop (PLL or FLL). Coherent correlation combined with differential or non-coherent correlation can be done for the pilot and the data channel (Schmid et al., 2004). Multiple signals will be available at L1 within the next few years (Hein et al., 2004). Galileo will use a different modulation scheme for its signals such as BOC and QPSK, while
GPS uses binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation for the open signals at L1 and L2. The L5 signal that will appear with the Block IIF satellites in 2006, will have quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK).
The binary offset carrier (BOC) modulation scheme of Galileo provides better multipath and receiver noise performance compared to the GPS binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation. More complex techniques are already developed for tracking BOC signal, such as bump jump and BPSK-like.

The definition of reference coordinate system is crucial for the description of satellite motion, the modeling of observable and the interpretation of results. Reference coordinate system in satellite geodesy is global and geocentric by nature since satellite motion refers to the center of mass of the earth (Seeber, 2003; Hofmann-Wellenhof et al., 2001).
In satellite geodesy, two reference systems are required: (a) space-fixed, inertial reference system for the description of satellite motion, and (b) earth-fixed, terrestrial reference system for the positions of the observation stations and for the description of results from satellite geodesy.
The positioning with using GNSS depends mainly on knowing the satellite coordinates. The position of the receiver is calculated with respect to the instant position of the satellite. By considering the range vector relation between satellite and receiver, the coordinate of the satellite and receiver should be expressed in the same coordinate system.
In satellite geodesy, the two systems are used and the transformation parameters between the space fixed and earth fixed are well known and used directly in the GNSS receiver and post processing software to compute the position of the receivers in the earth fixed system.
Terrestrial reference system is defined by convention with three axes, where Z-axis coincides with the earth rotation axis as defined by the Conventional International Origin (CIO). The X- axis is associated with the mean Greenwich meridian, and the Y-axis is orthogonal to both Z and X axes and it completes the right-handed coordinate system, Fig. 9. One example of the terrestrial reference system is the WGS84. GPS has used the WGS84 as a reference system (Leick, 2003), and with WGS84 associated a geocentric equipotential ellipsoid of revolution.
The basic idea, in geodesy, behind using the reference ellipsoids is that they fit the real shape of the earth.
Another example of terrestrial reference frame is the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF), which is established by Central Bureau of the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS). The ITRF is regularly updated and is more accurate than WGS84, but the difference between WGS84 and ITRF is now in the order of a few centimeters. This difference is mainly due to the difference between the reference stations used by each system when it is realized.
Both systems are geocentric and the transformation parameters between them are regularly published by IERS.
The representation of position in geocentric Cartesian coordinates (X, Y and Z) has less significance in navigation. Hence, the ellipsoidal representation (longitude, latitude and height above the ellipsoid) are more commonly use for coordinate representation.
The relation between Cartesian coordinate (X, Y, Z) and ellipsoidal coordinates ( , , and h) is well known by using the following formulas:
X  (N  h) cos cos 
 
Y  (N  h) cos sin 
2
Z  ( a 2 N  h) sin 
 
(2)
 
where N is the radius of curvature in prime vertical and is obtained by the following expression:


 
2
N 	,
 
(3)
 



Here, a, b are the semi axes of the ellipsoid. The Cartesian coordinate of WGS84 is called also ECEF (Earth Centered Earth-Fixed) coordinate system.
As mentioned above, the realization of the reference frame depends on the coordinates of ground reference stations. The Galileo Terrestrial Reference Frame (GTRF) is expected to be similar to ITRF, but will be based on the coordinates of the Galileo ground stations. The differences between WGS84, ITRF and the GTRF are expected to be in the order of a few centimeters. The two coordinate systems are compatible, and the accuracy obtained is good enough for most of the applications including navigation. For high precise measurements and for centmetric accuracy between the various systems, the transformation parameters are expected to be published by the geodetic service providers such as IERS. Glonass uses the PZ90 as a reference coordinate system which is basically a ECEF system. The transformation parameters between PZ90 and WGS84 is published by IERS (Leick, 2003).

5.2	Time Reference Frame

There are many time reference systems used and they are based on various periodic processes such as the earth rotation. The major types of these systems are shown in Table 1.

The conversion between time systems is accomplished by well known formulas. In GNSS (e.g GPS), instead of the dynamic time system itself, the atomic time system serves as reference.
Glonass satellite clock is moved according to UTC (SU). The Galileo System Time (GST) will be a continuous coordinate time scale steered towards the International Atomic Time (ITA) with an offset of less then 33 nanoseconds. The GST limits, expressed as a time offset relative to ITA,
should be 50 nanoseconds for 95 percent of the time over any yearly time interval. The difference between GST and ITA and between GST and UTC shall be broadcast to the users using the signal-in-space of each Galileo service. The Galileo ground segment will monitor the offset of the GST with respect to the GPS system time and eventually broadcast the offset to users.

6.	OBSERVATION TECHNIQUES

The basic concept of GNSS is to measure the signal traveling time between artificial satellite and receiver. By multiplying this time by the light velocity (c), we get the range between the satellite and the receiver [(Hofmann-Wellenhof et al., 2001; ; Leick, 2003); see Figure 10:
 (4)
 

The time or phase measurement performed by the receiver is based on the comparison between the received signal at the antenna of the receiver and the generated reference signal by the receiver. The two signals are affected by the clocks errors. Therefore, the range measured is not true and it is called pseudorange. Since the signal travels through the atmospheric layers, further noise should be modeled in order to compute the precise range.

6.1	Code Pseudorange Measurements


Code correlation technique is used to measure the time difference between the received and generated replica code. The range could be formulated as follows:

 
S  c  (t
 


R (GNSS )
 

  R
 
)  (t S (GNSS )   S )
 
(5)
 
where  S
 
is the satellite clock offset  S
 
and  R
 
is the receiver clock offset  R . A high stability
 
atomic clock is generally used on board of the satellite, so  S
 
is small and could be modeled by
 
a polynomial with the coefficients being transmitted in the navigation message. However, the
 
receiver clock offset  R
 
is large and is treated as unknown to be estimated in the function:
 


 
S  c  t
 

GNSS
 
 c  ( S  
 
)    c  
 
(6)
 
where	is the true distance between satellite and receiver and its expressed by the vector in reference geocentric coordinate system as:

 
 
 
(7)
 


6.2	Phase Pseudorange Measurements


Phase pseudo range is based on the measurements of phase difference between the received and generated signal  S at the receiver. The received carrier is Doppler shifted due to the motion of satellite (Hofmann-Wellenhof et al., 2001).
 
In order to calculate the range using phase measurement, we have to add to  S
 
the number of
 
cycles between the satellite and the receiver, which is an ambiguous value and is often called ambiguity (N). By considering the initial phase errors of the satellite and receiver due to their clocks, the mathematical model of phase pseudo range can be expressed by:

 
 S  N   f    f S  f
 
 
(8)
 
R	c	R

 
If we rearrange the above equation and use    s and    S  
 
, the it becomes similar
 
to the code pseudo range equation, but with the additional the ambiguity value (N):

 
      c      N
 
(9)
 


where  is the wave length.


6.3	GNSS observable errors
The code and phase measurements are affected by noise and errors due to the propagation of signals through atmospheric layers and due to the noise measurements. These errors can described briefly as below:
 
1.	Satellite clock error: This can be modeled by the polynomial coefficients transmitted in the navigation message with respect to a reference time (e.g. GPS).
 
 S  a
 
 a1 (t  t0
 
)  a2
 
(t  t0 )
 
(10)
 


2.	Orbital error: This can be eliminated by differential positioning. Precise orbits could be obtained in near real time via Internet from the services centers such as International GNSS Service (IGS).

3.	Ionospheric error: This error is modeled or eliminated by using the linear combination of two or multiple frequencies (Julien et al., 2004b). The relation between the ionospheric effect on the future GNSS (L5, L2 and L1 for GPS; E5a, E5b and E1 for GALILEO) using the triple frequency could be written as follows:
1  1    c    1  N  I L1
f 2
 
2   2    c    2

       c    
 
 N   1  I
2
f 2
 N   1  I
 

 
(11)
 
3	3	3
 
2	L1
3
 
where, Ionosphere  I L1


The effect of ionosphere on GNSS measurement is of special interest in solving the ambiguity number N (Liu and Lachapelle, 2002). Having multiple frequency can give more advantages for ionosphere models to estimate the first and second order effect of the ionosphere. Moreover, it allows more possibilities in ambiguity resolution process (Zhang, et al., 2003). Ionosphere could also be modeled using the ionospheric coefficient transmitted by the navigation message.

4.	The troposphere: This consists of two layers: Wet layer (up to 10 km above the surface of ground), and dry layer from 10 to 40 km above the ground. Troposphere causes a delay in both the code and carrier observations. Since it is not frequency dependent, it cannot be canceled out by using dual frequency measurements but it can, however, be successfully modeled. Tropospheric models depend on empirical models by considering all values of temperature, pressure, relative humidity and mapping function. Examples of such models are the Hopfield, and Saastamoninen models.
 
5.	Receiver clock error: This is due to using non-precise clock in the receiver (e.g. quartz clock), which causes offset and drift in the receiver clock and GNSS reference time. This error is treated as unknown in the pseudo range computations. The clock receiver error could be eliminated in double difference equation as shown in the follow section.

6.	Multipath: This is caused by multiple reflections of the signals at the receiver or at the satellite due to multiple paths taken by the signal to arrive to the destination. The best way to reduce multipath phenomenon is to choose the site away from reflection surface (such as buildings, cars, trees, etc), and by appropriate antenna design. Carrier phase are less affected by multipath propagation than code ranges, because multipath is frequency dependent. The multipath error could reach to a one meter level. The elimination of multipath is possible by selecting an antenna that takes advantages of the signal polarization.

6.4	GNSS Positioning Techniques
There are two main types of positioning techniques in GNSS measurements: single point positioning and differential positioning.

6.4.1	Single Point Positioning
The basic concept of point position depends on the trilatration between the receiver and satellite. Range measurements from 4 satellites is needed to determine the four unknown X, Y, Z and receiver clock offset (  ). The analytical solution for receiver A and 4 satellites could be written as below :

 
R1 (t) 
R 2 (t) 
R 2 (t) 
R 4 (t) 
 
 c  
 c  
 c  
 c  
 


(12)
 


Generally, linearization respect to approximate position of the receiver is needed to resolve such model, where the range R is measured by the receiver and the coordinate of satellite is extracted
 
from the navigation message. The unknowns in the above equation are X, Y, Z and the clock error  . In case of observing more than 4 satellites, the least square adjustment is performed to estimate the unknowns.
Hence, coordinates of the receiver and time offset could be obtained directly in real time with one epoch measurement. Geometric information could be obtained from equation model as PDOP which indicates the quality of the solution with respect to satellite geometry. Bad satellite distribution give large PDOP. Due to un-modeled errors in pseudo range such as ionosphere, troposphere, and orbital errors, the accuracy level of absolute positioning is within 10 meter.

6.4.2	Observable difference
By considering all the systematic and random errors on the observation, we can write the math model for observable difference for code and phase measurements, respectively, as below:

 
R1 (t
 
)  1 (t
 
)  1 (t
 
)  c 1(t
 
)  c
 
A (t0
 
)  I A
 
 TA  
 
(13)
 
1 (t
 
)   1 (t
 
)   1 (t
 
)  N 1  c 1 (t
 
)  c
 

A (t0
 
)  I A
 
 TA  
 
(14)
 


 
Where  S
 
is the orbital error, I is the ionosphere error, T is the troposphere error and ε is the
 
other types of noise and errors such as the ones due to multipath.


Using two receivers A and B and satellite (1), we can perform Single Differences (SD). In SD the orbital error and satellite clock error are cancelled. By using two receivers and two satellites (1, 2), we can perform Double Differences (DD). In DD the clock receiver error is cancelled. By using two receivers, two satellites and two consequent epochs, we can perform Triple Differences (TD). In TD the ambiguity is cancelled.
 
SD  1 (t)  1 (t)  1 (t)  1
 
(t)	 N 1  c	(t )
 
AB	B
 
A	AB
 
AB	AB  0
 
DD  12 (t)  1 12 (t)  N 12
 
 
(15)
 
AB		AB	AB
 
TD  12 (t
 
)  1 12 (t )
 
AB  12
 
 
	AB  12
 
As we see, most of systematic errors are cancelled or reduced with using the observable differences. Consequently, the accuracy of position computation will be improved after eliminating or reducing of these biases. Solution obtained in DD with ambiguity can provide a precision to the centimeteric level.

6.4.3	Differential position
There is an increase interest in differential positioning due to the numerous advantages of wireless communications and networks. Most of errors that affect GNSS are common between the receivers, which observe the same set of satellites (Leick, 2003; Hofmann-Wellenhof et al., 2001). Thus, by making differential measurement between two or more receivers, most of these errors could be cancelled.

The basic concept of differential position is the calculation of position correction or range correction at the reference receiver and then sending this correction to the other receiver via radio link. This way most of errors are cancelled; see Fig.11. The transmitted correction could be of several types: the position or pseudo range correction, the carrier smoothed pseudo range correction, and the carrier phase correction. The mathematical model of DGNSS could be written as shown below. Two receivers are used, where receiver A is installed at known reference station and B is rover/moving receiver. Pseudo range at A is given by:
As we see the orbital error is cancelled and the satellite clock error is eliminated. We can also transmit the phase correction to the rover receiver. In this case we have to add another unknown; the ambiguity N, to the equations. The phase range correction between the reference and the rover receiver when applying the same above procedure will be given by:

 
1 (t)	 1 (t)  N1   c
 
(t)
 
(22)
 
B	corr	B	AB	AB


DGNSS with phase range correction is used for most precision Real-Time Kinematics (RTK). But the ambiguity should be resolved or fixed by using the On The Fly (OTF) techniques. In phase measurement technique the precision obtained will be at the centimeter level. Modeling the ionosphere and troposphere will eliminate or reduce the errors in DGNSS. This method gives more possibilities to obtain high accuracy in point positioning using one receiver.

6.4.4	Wide Area Differential GNSS (WADGNSS)
WADGNSS is a scheme that would allow the user to perform differential positioning and obtain reliable position with high accuracy in real time over a sizeable region. WADGNSS consists of a master control station and number of local or Global monitor stations and communication link.
The monitor stations gather the data from GNSS satellite, then send them to the master control station. The master control estimates the ionosphere parameter, troposphere parameters, satellite ephemeredes and clock errors. All these corrections are transmitted to the user via the Internet, wireless communications or satellite communications.

Depending on the distribution of the reference monitor stations and the accuracy of error modeling and communication capabilities, the accuracy of rover receiver could be in the range of 1 -3m. Centimeteric accuracy could be achieved by receiving phase correction and ambiguity fixing such as the RTK and Virtual Reference Station (VRS). Programs are already developed to send the GNSS corrections to the user to obtain a higher accuracy. As mentioned above, transmitting a phase correction with error models for ambiguity fixing will give centmetric precision for the rover receiver.
Wireless communications and Internet have offered us with new possibilities to applied real time positioning to obtain centimetric precision using one receiver (Leick, 2003).

The mathematical model of WADGNSS can be written by adding all the errors affected the satellite signals:
 
 1 (t
 
)   1 (t
 
)   1 (t
 
)  N 1  c 1 (t
 
)  c
 
A (t0
 
)  I A
 
 TA
 
(23)
 
The most common Satellite-Based Augmentation System (SBAS) programs used in WADGNSS are: WAAS, EGNOS and MSAS (WAAS, 2002; GALILEO, 2003)

Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)
Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) is a new augmentation to the United States Department of Defense’s (DoD) Global Positioning System (GPS) that is designed to enhance the integrity and accuracy of the basic GPS capability.
The WAAS uses geo-stationary satellites to receive data measured from many ground stations, and it sends information to GPS users for position correction. Since WAAS satellites are of the geo-stationary type, the Doppler frequency caused by their motion is very small. Thus, the signal transmitted by the WAAS can be used to calibrate the sampling frequency in a GPS receiver.
The WAAS signal frequency is at 1575.42 MHz. The WAAS services will be available on both L1 and L5.

GNSS-1 : EGNOS
The European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) is being developed by European Space Agency (ESA), for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol). EGNOS will complement the GNSS systems. It consists of three transponders installed in geostationary satellites and a ground network of 34 positioning stations and four control centers, all interconnected. EGNOS as WAAS broadcast the differential corrections to the GNSS users through Geo-stationary satellites, in the European region and beyond.

MSAS
 
Similar to the WAAS and EGNOS, the Japanese MTSAT Satellite-Based Augmentation System (MSAS) is used to send the differential correction for GNSS users; see Figure 12.


7.	WIRELESS SYSTEMS AND GNSS APPLICATIONS.

Wireless communication and network systems offer a new line of GNSS applications by sending the differential position corrections to the GNSS users. Other applications forced GNSS to be integrated with wireless communications, such as the third generation (3G) wireless mobile networks for RTK network (VRS). Other applications are also integrated with GIS and wireless communications such as LBS applications (emergency call and AVL).

On the other hand, GNSS is used in digital communication networks to meet the requirement for precision timing synchronization and position information. Increased timing accuracy provides overall improvements in system performance in terms of quality and efficiency. The telecommunications infrastructure uses the GNSS signal as an integral and basic part of the system.
GNSS could improve the communication capacity of networks, especially for the UMTS third- generation using Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) techniques. A precise time- synchronization of the different base stations (the UMTS emitter-antennas) can significantly increase the traffic capability of the system.
7.1	Timing and synchronization
The characteristic of good telecommunications service is to be continuous and the transmission of information (transmission packet) should be of low error rate and noise. Such a good performance can be accomplished by using precise timing and efficient synchronization mechanisms. GNSS technology is frequently used for this purpose because the GNSS chip (actually GPS chip), has low cost and the timing information can be obtained easily from one satellite with high stability characteristics.
All the clocks installed in the nodes of wireless networks should match or trace the Synchronization Standard established by The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for
-11
performance of a primary reference source as 1x10	. The GNSS chip is relatively inexpensive.
Naturally interference or jamming of GNSS signal could affect the timing synchronization in the telecommunications network, which consequently degrades telecommunications services (Omar and Rizos, 2003).

7.2	GNSS and wireless network
There are many types of wireless networks, cellular networks, Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) and multi-hop wireless networks for providing Internet services and control systems (Nicopolitidis et al., 2003). GNSS technology is not widely used in wireless networks for positioning of information since most protocols and algorithms in wireless networks do not use position information in their operation. Even though it is very advantageous for many applications such as providing Internet services for mobile users (cars, trains..etc) (Jain et al., 2001).
Geographical Routing Algorithm (GRA) is generally used in wireless networks for packet destination between nodes without good knowledge of network topology. Using GNSS for location information and time synchronization will help to optimize packets’ routes to the destination between the nodes in the Ad hoc wireless network and increase the efficiency of services by selecting the closest nodes (shortest path).

7.3	RTK Network
RTK network concept is similar to the WADGNSS but the reference stations are generally distributed over a regional area and the network control center is responsible for transmitting the phase measurement correction to the GNSS user (rover receiver). Mobile wireless networks (GSM, GPRS, EDGE, CDMA2000 and UMTS) are generally used in this type of applications due to the need of duplex communication where the rover receiver should send initially the approximate position to the network processing center. The network processing center computes VRS observations and sends it to the user (Euler, 2005), see Figure 13. This scheme is commonly used in many systems worldwide due to its economic and precision advantages. The
number of reference stations in the single RTK approach are 30 stations in 10,000 km2 , however, by using the RTK network, the reference stations could be reduced to 5 stations in the
10,000 km2 area.

7.4	Location Based Service (LBS)
Location Based Services (LBSs) provide personalized services to the subscriber based on their current position. LBSs employ accurate, real-time positioning to connect users to nearby points
of interest. LBS advises them of the current conditions such as traffic and weather, or provides routing and tracking information--all via wireless devices.
Location of the caller is generally determined by various position determination techniques. These include Cell-ID, Enhanced Observed Time Difference (E-OTD), Observed Timed Difference of Arrival (OTDOA), Wireless Assisted GNSS (A-GNSS) and hybrid technologies (combining A-GNSS with other standard technologies).
Positioning techniques based on the use of a GNSS or cellular network infrastructure itself is growing rapidly in the mobile-telephone community. There are many LBS projects already based on the combination of wireless communications (e.g., GMTS), satellite navigation (GNSS) and geographic information systems (GIS). Some of these projects are based on the Mobile Client / Server architecture (Lohnert et al., 2001).
The LBS applications and needs could be divided into four main areas:
1.	Information and navigation services: These services provide data directly to end-users, in particular destination location and criteria for trip optimization.
2.	Emergency assistance: This type of service provides the location of mobile users in case of distress and need for assistance such as: E-911 in US and E-112 in Europe. GIS capabilities are essential in such services.
3.	Tracking services: In genral, an AVL system consists of GNSS receiver integrated with GSM/GPRS module mounted on the vehicle, communication link between the vehicle and the dispatcher, and PC-based tracking software for dispatching (Figure 14) (Al- Bayari and Sadoun, 2005).
4.	Network related services: Here knowledge of user position improves communication services. Location can be achieved by integrating a GNSS receiver in the mobile phone (handheld solution) or by using the communication network itself.
LBS techniques based on GSM, GPRS and WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) networks alone don’t offer high accuracy. Moreover, GNSS alone is insufficient to maintain continuous positioning due to the inevitable difficulties caused by obstacles. When GNSS signals are blocked or lost, the precision of positioning will be minimized to unacceptable level. Hence, it is necessary to improve the accuracy and reliability of GNSS position.
 
The accuracy of position determination could be improved by Differential GNSS (DGNSS), Dead Reckoning (DR), indoor GNSS, or integrating GNSS with the above mentioned schemes such as Cell-ID (Hybrid location technology).

8.	CONCLUSION

Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) technology has become vital to many applications that range from city planning engineering and zoning to military applications. It has been widely accepted globally by governments and organizations. That is why we expect to have very soon at least three GNSS systems: the USA GPS, European Galileo, and the Russian Glonass systems.
There is a multibillion dollar investment in this field and intensive worldwide research activities. The impressive progress in wireless communications and networks has played a great role in increasing interest in GNSS and providing enabling methodologies and mechanisms. It is expected that all 3G and future generations of cellular phones will be equipped with GNSS chips. GNSS technology dominates the outdoor navigation, which provides accuracy to the range of few meters to 10 m in single point positioning technique or sub-meter to a few meter level in differential GNSS technique (DGNSS). Different techniques have been developed recently for
indoor positioning. They offer either absolute or relative positioning capabilities with acceptable precision (Hightower and Borriello 2001). Combining these technologies with GNSS allows to provide a more reliable and robust location solution. Most common implementation of Hybrid technology for GSM, GPRS and WCDMA is to combine A-GNSS with Cell-ID.
